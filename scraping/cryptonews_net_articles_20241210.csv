Rising Crypto Trading Volume , US Shares in South Korea
According to the Korean media outlet
Korea Herald
, as of last Friday afternoon at 3:30 PM, the 24-hour trading volume of the top five crypto exchanges in South Korea i.e., Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax was $14.59 billion. This figure is equivalent to 20.72 trillion Korean won, nearly twice the trading volume of the Kospi that day, which was 10.48 trillion Korean won.
As of today, Upbit has registered a 24-hour trading volume of $11.34 billion. Another leading crypto exchange, Bithumb, has reported a 24-hour trading volume of $3.63 billion. Korbit and Coinone recorded 24-hour trading volumes of $102 million and $317 million, respectively. According to data analytics from
Messari
, Gopax saw a 24-hour trading volume of $1.34 million.
Apart from this, South Korean investors are increasingly investing in U.S. shares as they lose faith in the local stock market.
While the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (Kospi) dropped to a low of under 2,400, closing at 2,360.58 on Monday, retail investors are pouring money into U.S. stocks.

According to the Korea Securities Depository, local Korean investors traded shares worth $63.49 billion in the U.S. market last month. In fact, investors are also turning to Tesla shares, which have become the top choice for Korean investors, with transaction volumes reaching $7.7 billion.
Moreover, the KOSDAQ Index in South Korea plummeted 5% intraday, while the decline in the South Korean Kospi Index expanded to 2.6%, painting a stark picture of growing dissatisfaction among the general population regarding market trends.
This volatility in the stock market highlights the grave repercussions of President Yoon Suk Yeol’s unexpected declaration of martial law, following which South Korean officials in charge of the anti-corruption investigation office imposed a travel ban on President Yoon Suk Yeol.
Market analysts project that investment flows could shift further toward overseas markets.
At the same time, the value of the Korean won against the U.S. dollar plunged to 1,437 won during intraday trading and failed to recover by the end of the trading day.
Local media reports stated, “Korean investors bought U.S. shares worth $1.3 billion on Thursday, a 6.4% decline from the previous day. On Friday, purchases fell to $1.12 billion, down by 14%. Sales also plunged by 10% and 21.3% on Thursday and Friday, respectively.”
“The won-dollar exchange rate is likely to fluctuate in the 1,400-won range, considering that the political chaos is likely to continue with discussions of Yoon Suk Yeol’s impeachment,” analyst Lee Jae-man from Hana Securities said.",https://www.cryptonewsz.com/south-koreas-political-crypto-trade-us-stocks/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-10 04:35:54.892696,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/285/285afd29cf7366250f01ac53909e35a7be9f68fd.webp,Successfully Scraped
news/bitcoin/30203677/,Bitcoin Cycle Top Still Ahead? Key Levels to Watch,"Bitcoin’s upward momentum shows no signs of slowing down, with analysts suggesting the market cycle top may still be ahead. According to Titan of Crypto, a market analyst, the token’s monthly RSI indicates further growth prospects. Historically, cycle tops in 2013, 2017, and 2021 coincided with the RSI reaching the overbought zone, a threshold that remains untested in the current bull market.
The shared analysis highlights Bitcoin’s consistent cyclical patterns, showing that corrections are a normal part of the climb toward new highs. Titan of Crypto’s chart reveals that Bitcoin is following an upward trajectory, with the trend line suggesting a possible push toward a new all-time high. The analyst encourages traders to focus on the bigger picture,
reminding them
, “When in doubt, zoom out.”
Bitcoin’s Key Levels to Watch
Since mid-November, Bitcoin has climbed within an ascending channel, steadily building momentum as its price approached a critical resistance near $99,661. This surge was briefly interrupted by a retracement to $90,767, where the bulls regrouped and reignited the rally. Riding this wave of enthusiasm, the token shattered the $100,000 milestone, soaring to a new all-time high of $103,900.
However, this uptick was followed by a natural pullback, with the cryptocurrency finding solid footing just below the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $94,208. From there, Bitcoin has stabilized, trading at $97,727 at press time—marking a modest 1.92% dip over the past 24 hours. At this level, the BTC token hovers near the lower boundary of the ascending channel, a zone that historically acts as a springboard for price recoveries.
Should this trend hold, BTC could soon retest its prior highs, with $101,430 emerging as the immediate hurdle. A successful breakthrough here may pave the way for the cryptocurrency to challenge its all-time high, setting its sights on new heights. In this scenario, Bitcoin could ascend to uncharted territory around $114,004—a 16% leap from its current value—by year’s end.
This outlook is further bolstered by Titan of Crypto’s ambitious projection of $160,000, reflecting growing market optimism. On the flip side, should the BTC cryptocurrency fail to maintain support near the 78.6% Fibonacci level at $95,978, a retest of $91,000—the price last seen on December 5—may be in play.
A further slide toward the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement at $89,746 could spell trouble, possibly invalidating the bullish structure. Such a development might signal a lower low, sparking concerns of a trend reversal and shifting the market sentiment toward bearish territory.",https://www.cryptonewsz.com/bitcoin-cycle-top-still-ahead-levels-to-watch/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-10 04:33:55.649751,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/e47/e473341703d935757c2c6e772d0f440dcaabe173.webp,Successfully Scraped
news/analytics/30203840/,XRP Price Prediction For December 10,"XRP has slipped to the fourth position and is down by more than 14 percent in the last 24 hours. The price is slightly trading above the $2 level at the time of writing. XRP has tested a key breakout point and the 2021 high, and this retest has resulted in a strong rebound. However, the price has not yet surpassed any previous highs, indicating that further movement is needed to establish an upward trend.
The current market structure suggests that XRP may still be in the fourth wave of a larger correction. After a three-wave decline in wave A, followed by a three-wave rise in wave B, XRP is now experiencing the C-wave decline. Despite the rebound, the price has not surpassed previous highs, which means further movement is needed for confirmation of an upward trend.
Potential for More Downside
Despite the rebound, it is still possible, even likely, that we could see one more low. There is no confirmation yet that the low has been established. During liquidity events, such as those we’ve been seeing recently, rapid price movements make it difficult to pinpoint the micro-structure of the waves. While another dip cannot be ruled out, it’s important to note that the price has already hit the 100% extension of the A-wave, which is a common target for a C-wave.
Next Support Levels
If the price continues to move downward, the next support levels to watch are around $1.85, where we see an overlap of two key support zones, followed by $1.78 and $1.66. The market is still following the forecasted path, and it’s crucial to monitor how the broader crypto market, including Bitcoin, behaves, as this could impact XRP’s next move.",https://coinpedia.org/news/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-december-10/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-10 04:26:56.051406,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/862/8624d761f89719e7a27f32a31c1ac359277795b3.webp,Successfully Scraped

On December 10, 2024, the whale transaction tracker Lookonchain posted on X (formerly Twitter) that a high-profile trading firm, Cumberland, had dumped a significant 989,520 UNI tokens worth $16.73 million.
The firm dumped these substantial tokens on Binance, Coinbase, OKX, and Robinhood. Additionally, the sell-off began shortly after UNI’s price dropped by 10%.

During the same period, its trading volume surged by 15%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors amid a bearish outlook, which suggests that further price declines are expected in the future.
UNI Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels
The recent price decline has brought UNI to the crucial $16 level, which was a breakout point. UNI was expected to retest this level, but the price decline has brought it here sooner than anticipated. Based on expert technical analysis, if UNI holds above $14.90, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 20% to reach the $19.75 level in the coming days.

news/analytics/30203651/,"PEPE Defies the Market Trend, Eyes on 30% Rally","Pepe (PEPE), the popular third-largest crypto meme coin, is making waves and gaining widespread attention from crypto enthusiasts. On December 10, 2024, PEPE is outperforming major cryptocurrencies and defying the market trend with its impressive performance.
PEPE Current Price Momentum
PEPE is trading near $0.00002725 at press time, having recorded a price gain of over 3.50% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume increased by 16%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day.
However, this modest price surge comes during a period when the majority of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL), are struggling to gain momentum.
PEPE Technical Analysis
With this recent price surge, PEPE has reached a crucial level of $0.00002750, which currently represents a make-or-break situation for the meme coin. According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, if PEPE closes a four-hour candle above $0.00002750, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 30% to reach $0.000036 in the coming days.
Source: Trading View
On the other hand, if PEPE fails to hold above the $0.000024 level, this bullish thesis may be invalidated. PEPE’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests a potential upside rally in the coming days, as it remains below the overbought zone.
Notable Outflow

On December 9, Spot on Chain detected a diamond-hand whale who deposited the remaining of his 11,639 ETH tokens to Kraken. The move, which amounts to $46.37 million at the current market price, has captured the market’s attention.
As reported by the on-chain tracker, this whale in the past withdrew 96,639 ETH from Coinbase at $1,580 in September 2022. The investor later deposited all of the amounts to Kraken at $3,080 between March and December 2024.

Whale lose patience
Diamond-hand whales are big crypto holders who resist selling their tokens despite inherent price fluctuations. They have a strong belief in the long-term prospect of their holdings. In this case, the Ether whale, whose wallet holds a large amount of Ethereum tokens, surprised the market with the huge transfer.
Of late, large investors, popularly known as crypto whales, increasingly resurface in the market, seeking to make gains amid the rejuvenated price increase. On-chain data shows big transfers of major assets to exchanges. This appears to cause a short-term correction in many assets following weeks of price uptick. Typically, the bull cycle influences big investors to buy assets and later sell them for profit. Although dumping tokens on exchanges might cause price correction, market participants see it as a natural course of events.
Large Ether transactions surge
Ethereum has experienced a steady rise of huge transactions, with weekly volumes hitting $17.15 billion (an increase of over 300%) before settling down to $7 billon currently. This is attributed to increased whale activity, aligning with the current Ether’s price spike. The rise has ignited curiosity about Ether’s price movement and the impact of these transactions.
Typically, the steady increase in the number of big investor transactions indicates increased high-net-worth activity. The rise coincides with Ether’s recent surge to $4,080, showing that some whales could be redistributing holdings or taking profits.
ETH price might see a short-term correction
As highlighted above, such trading activities have an impact on ETH prices. Current on-chain metrics indicate that ETH Exchange Netflow has been positive, meaning investors are depositing a net number of tokens into platforms. The key reason holders transfer their tokens to these platforms is to sell to make returns. However, this trend could cause the asset’s price to become bearish. Ether is currently trading below $4,000 and showing some bearish signs.
The asset is currently trading at $3,940.18, up 7.40% in the last seven days. On-chain data indicates a likely short-term price correction after the crypto’s 35% uptrend momentum over the past 30 days. ETH recently soared above the $4,000 level, prompting concerns that it was overbought.
As its value rises to this key resistance level, the metrics indicate a selling pressure could heighten, possibly causing a fallback before any further upward trend. ETH’s price is displaying a few bearish signs below the $3,922 support. The token could take a bearish momentum if it potentially moves below $3,700.",https://blockchainreporter.net/diamond-hand-whale-deposits-massive-11639-eth-46-37m-to-kraken-is-price-correction-looming/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-10 03:09:57.595305,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/29e/29e0e34e0a585c8a2045cd0e8b9f4f84a6ac1355.webp,Successfully Scraped
news/bitcoin/30203565/,Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs Add Billions Amid Record Week: CoinShares,"Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds have witnessed an unprecedented appetite from institutional investors this year, and the numbers, particularly in December, continue to impress.
A record-breaking $3.85 billion flowed into digital asset funds last week, fueled by Wall Street's insatiable demand, according to a CoinShares report on Monday.
BlackRock's iShares ETFs accounted for $3.2 billion of those inflows, taking its total value of crypto assets under management to $56.7 billion.
Inflows into Ethereum products also hit a fresh all-time high of $1.2 billion last week, surpassing volumes seen when the Securities and Exchange Commission first approved U.S. spot ETH ETFs in July, CoinShares reported.
The U.S. has now cemented itself as the primary market for digital asset investment products, representing $3.6 billion in total inflows.
Switzerland was in distant second place at $160 million—followed by Germany, Canada, and Australia.
All of this comes amid speculation that ETFs tracking the value of smaller cryptos, like
XRP
or
Solana
, could be given the green light to launch after Donald Trump returns to the Oval Office in January.
Last week, it was confirmed Wall Street ETF issuers now collectively own more Bitcoin than anyone else,
including the crypto's pseudonymous creator
, Satoshi Nakamoto.
The total market cap of Bitcoin ETFs is now $109 billion,
CoinGlass data shows
—more than MicroStrategy and Binance combined. MicroStrategy is the largest corporate treasury holder of Bitcoin, while Binance is the world’s top cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume.
However, analysis from CryptoQuant suggests all of this buying activity has been outgunned by selloffs by long-term Bitcoin holders, who have offloaded 827,783 BTC over the past 30 days.

That could explain why Bitcoin has struggled to maintain momentum above $100,000 since hitting the milestone price for the first time last week. As of this writing, Bitcoin’s price is near $97,000 after falling below the six-figure value on Monday.
BTC's growth—which eventually led to a market cap above $2 trillion and made it more valuable than the Australian dollar—has widely been attributed to institutional interest through ETFs rather than everyday investors.
Trump's imminent return to the White House, driven by a slew of pro-Bitcoin promises, is also playing a role. He's now appointed a ""crypto czar"" in the form of entrepreneur
David Sacks

news/legal/30203542/,Crypto advocacy groups target SEC’s Crenshaw in new Ad campaign,"Industry-backed crypto advocacy groups have launched targeted campaigns against the renomination of Caroline Crenshow in SEC. The campaigns are led from two ends, with CEDAR Innovation Foundation leading an online onslaught in social media, while Blockchain Association and DeFi Education Fund are writing to the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and
Urban Affairs.
Through X, Crenshaw is accused of being anti-crypto more than the outgoing chair of the commission, Gary Gensler. The
advocacy group
launched a new five-figure digital ad campaign that will be shared across all social media platforms in Washington, DC. The ad addresses lawmakers, urging them to reject Democratic commissioner Crenshaw’s renomination to the SEC.
The Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to vote on Crenshow’s renomination on Wednesday morning. If the House confirms her, Crenshaw will serve on the commission until June 2029, which advocates feel will undermine cryptocurrency as a whole.
Blockchain Association and DeFi Educational Fund write to the committee
As the campaign against Crenshaw is picking momentum in social media, the Blockchain Association and DeFi Education Fund have written a
letter
to the Senate to do their representation duty by voting against Crenshaw’s renomination.
The letter details several justifications as to why Crenshaw is not fit to hold a seat on the SEC. The group feels like Crenshaw can not uphold the rule of law. They cited a case where she has operated with impunity while overlooking the court’s position.
Crenshaw blatantly refused to approve spot Bitcoin ETP despite the DC Circuit Courts confirming that there is no justifiable reason for them to reject it. According to the advocacy groups, Crenshaw’s character doesn’t embody the SEC’s merit-neutral mission or the needs of American investors—including the one-fifth of Americans who own digital assets.
America’s incoming administration is taking an interest in crypto
The Senate is urged to reject her and the failed policies of the past instead of approving the nomination, which will have extreme consequences for crypto lovers. President-elect Donald Trump appears interested in digital assets and has committed to forming a special crypto reserve.
Trump said that America must start warming towards crypto, or it will be left behind. He highlights how other countries are leveraging crypto for their growth.

Tkachev, from the New People party, sent the proposal to Russia’s Finance Minister, Anton Siluanov, to create a bitcoin reserve similar to Russia’s traditional currencies reserves.
JUST IN: Russian State Duma Deputy Anton Tkachev proposed creating a strategic #Bitcoin reserve in Russia, RIA Novosti reports 🇷🇺 pic.twitter.com/PlwSp24RvF
— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) December 9, 2024
“I ask you, dear Anton Germanovich, to assess the feasibility of creating a strategic reserve of bitcoin in Russia by analogy with state reserves in traditional currencies,” the document reportedly stated. “If this initiative is approved, I ask you to submit it to the government of the Russian Federation for further implementation.”
“In conditions of limited access to traditional international payment systems for countries under sanctions, cryptocurrencies are becoming virtually the only instrument for international trade. The Central Bank of Russia is already preparing to launch an experiment in cross-border settlements in cryptocurrency,” the document reportedly goes on to explain.
Tkachev’s document explains that creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve could enhance Russia’s financial stability, noting that traditional currency reserves such as the dollar, euro, and yuan are all subject to inflation and sanctions, and that a new alternative independent of any individual country is needed.
This development continues the trend of countries looking to build a strategic bitcoin reserve, including the United States, El Salvador, Brazil, Poland, and others. An initiative led by the United States and President-elect Donald Trump, the U.S. is looking to build a strategic bitcoin reserve of over 1 million bitcoin, which appears to have caught the attention of certain Russian officials.
Just five days ago, Russian president Vladimir Putin publicly stated that no one can ban or prohibit the use of Bitcoin, and that it will continue to develop. Earlier this year, Putin also signed a new law legalizing Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining within the country.

Highlighting the need for reform under the SEC leadership of President-elect Donald Trump, Peirce outlined three key priorities to provide clarity and foster growth in the crypto space.
Hester Peirce Urges for Clarity on Crypto Regulation
Peirce emphasized the need to halt the alleged regulatory suppression of the crypto industry. “Step one is to stop this approach of trying to prevent crypto from getting access to the services that it needs — custody, for example — to move forward,” she stated, according to a post on X by FOX Journalist Eleanor Terrett.
She also called for clearer guidance on the SEC’s jurisdiction. “Provide clarity around which things are not within the SEC’s ambit, so which things are not securities and which people don’t have to think about the SEC’s regulatory framework,” Peirce said, stressing the importance of delineating regulatory boundaries.

Additionally, Peirce advocated for a collaborative approach between the SEC and industry stakeholders. “Work with entities involved in crypto to try to figure out how the existing rules apply and where adjustments need to be made,” she explained. She proposed an open, public process for this collaboration, adding, “It needs to be done in the public so that everyone can participate in it.”
Peirce’s comments also touched on concerns about “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” a term used to describe perceived efforts to restrict crypto businesses’ access to financial services. Her remarks suggest a potential shift in policy direction under new SEC leadership. Moreover, netizens expect the agency to drop its appeal against Ripple, terminate lawsuits against other crypto firms when Trump administration takes over.",https://www.cryptonewsz.com/hester-peirce-lays-out-sec-agenda-under-trump/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-10 01:10:00.218637,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/ee1/ee14ca52be53a4b1671b75f990f94bab35072aac.webp,Successfully Scraped

news/bitcoin/30203481/,"Bitcoin has been billed as the people’s money, but is it as decentralized as they want you to believe?","One of Bitcoin’s (BTC) major promises is freedom — the unshackling of the financial world from the constraints of the traditional (TradFi) system. How? Through decentralization, a trustless system allows for peer-to-peer exchanges of value.
Recently, the premier crypto has attracted a new tag — the people’s money — in reference to its supposed egalitarian design and function. But is BTC truly the all-embracing medium of exchange that its proponents make it out to be?
Financial analyst Vik Aggarwal has presented new bitinfocharts data faulting that notion. He shared his thoughts via a
LinkedIn post.
Nearly 75% of available Bitcoin is held by 2% of its addresses
According to the presentation, a paltry 2% of BTC addresses hold 74% of the digital asset. This highly concentrated power, Aggarwal says, contradicts BTC’s founding principles.
He explained:
Bitcoin was supposed to be decentralized, step away from the central banks, a freedom from authorities. Do you know it is actually the opposite of that?
~
Aggarwal
The analyst also said the concentration could spell trouble for the coin and its network should the few BTC whales decide to dump it. He gave the example of an unnamed Chinese firm that triggered a $649 million flash crash when it sold its holdings.
Contrasting thoughts on BTC decentralization
Aggarwal’s post received a lot of comments on the issue with some people criticizing
his claims
while others supported him. Maureen Salim is one of those in support. She depicted the 2% as dragons guarding the gold (BTC).
To her, investing in BTC is a high-stakes poker game in which small-scale traders are the chips. She agreed they’d suffer most of the whales decided to sell their stashes.
But to Olivier C., Aggarwal was missing the point. He explained that by decentralization, Bitcoiners meant the consensus protocol, which protected the BTC platform. Meanwhile, distribution refers to the amounts held by the wallets.
He added that the anti-BTC propaganda was TradFi’s way of continuing to control the financial system. Olivier insisted that BTC was the key to unlocking the free economy.
What next for BTC decentralization?
The debate on BTC decentralization has remained thorny for a long time. However, it’s coming back to the fore following increased interest in the asset by institutional investors.
Some say that shift is beneficial to the coin as it shows the confidence of large-scale investors in BTC. Meanwhile, other crypto users are wary that the entry of big-monied players in the space makes the coin inaccessible to retailers.
As the debate rages, there’s a growing need to audit Bitcoin’s evolution to ensure it stays true to the creator’s intentions.",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-bitcoin-as-decentralized/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-10 00:10:01.417208,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/ffd/ffd96d0a34cf4ef610bbabe724f7e14cd7fb755d.webp,Successfully Scraped
news/analytics/30203475/,Solana (SOL) Reaches Key Level: What's Next? XRP Finds New Skyrocket Fuel? Pepe (PEPE) Becomes Meme Coin Leader,"The 26 EMA, which has traditionally served as a foundation for the rally's continuation, is now a crucial support level for Solana. For the cryptocurrency, this level, which is currently at $229, marks a significant turning point. It might open the door for another short-term upward push if Solana is able to maintain above this support.
It is incorrect to interpret the recent retracement to this support level as a bearish indication. Rather, it represents a sound correction within a continuous upward trend enabling the market to recover its strength. In recent months, Solana has shown tenacity, and its recovery from key support areas indicates that bulls are still in charge. Looking at particular price points if the 26 EMA does not hold the $210 region acts as backup support.
The immediate resistance level on the upside is $250. The bullish trend will continue if there is a breakout above this level, which might indicate a retest of the most recent high, which was close to $260. Volume patterns point to a decline during the most recent pullback, which is consistent with a normal corrective stage as opposed to a reversal. As SOL gets closer to resistance levels, a spike in buying volume could nevertheless signal fresh bullish momentum.
Additionally, the RSI is close to neutral territory, suggesting that Solana has space to expand without going into overbought territory. Further evidence for the potential for a sizable upward move in the days or weeks ahead comes from this technical setup.
XRP's fuel
Since the cryptocurrency seems to be forming a descending flag pattern, XRP is navigating through a critical phase. A possible reversal point is frequently indicated by this configuration, and for XRP it might be the beginning of another big move. Although the price is consolidating, the formation indicates that there is a chance for growth and recovery in the near future.
The given chart illustrates XRP's decline from its most recent peak of about $3. Despite its name, the pattern that is emerging on the daily timeframe is not always negative. During a longer bullish trend, descending flags frequently serve as a pause, allowing the asset to reassemble before continuing on its upward trajectory.
If the current consolidation phase ends well for XRP, this could indicate an upcoming breakout. One of the important levels to keep an eye on is the immediate resistance around $2.60, which corresponds to the flag's upper boundary. If this level is broken, XRP might move closer to $3 and perhaps even higher.
On the downside, the bullish structure will need to be maintained by support at $2.00 and $1.80. If these levels are dropped, it could indicate a more significant correction and change the positive outlook. As is common with flag patterns, the consolidation has resulted in a decline in trading volume.
Market players are holding off on making any more commitments until they see clear action. In order to verify the strength of the move, investors should keep a close eye on the volume as a breakout attempt approaches.
Pepe stands strong
Pepe has cemented its place as one of the top meme coins, considering its most recent performance. PEPE stands apart from many of its peers due to its resilience and upward momentum even in the face of minor setbacks in the larger crypto space.
Because of its constancy, it has attracted a lot of interest and established itself as a favorite among traders and investors. PEPE is regaining critical levels, according to recent price movements, laying a solid basis for possible future growth. The asset now seems to be consolidating after breaking through resistance at $0.0000240, and bullish sentiment indicates that higher levels may be within reach.
A crucial psychological and technical target for traders, $0.0000300, is the next resistance to keep an eye on. Providing investors with a safety net of $0.0000200 acts as a strong support level on the downside. PEPE's steady ascent can be ascribed to the community's ongoing interest and volume, which has helped it surpass earlier peaks.
In terms of the future, PEPE's outlook is optimistic. The amount of $0.0000350 might be the next target if the current momentum holds and PEPE breaks above $0.0000300. However, more purchases and more stable markets are needed to keep the market on this trajectory.",https://u.today/solana-sol-reaches-key-level-whats-next-xrp-finds-new-skyrocket-fuel-pepe-pepe-becomes-meme-coin?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-10 01:10:01.825366,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/1e5/1e5b43af983ca63f6e35d462616caabebda2a8a6.jpg,Successfully Scraped

news/bitcoin/30203379/,From $100k to $250k? Analyzing Bitcoin’s bull market signals,"Who would have thought we’d see Bitcoin shoot through the roof this quickly, soaring past $100K, albeit retreating slightly at present?
As we move forward into 2025, the main question on our minds is: what lies ahead? Is Bitcoin (BTC) a bubble about to burst, or are we on track for $150,000–$200,000 soon? Are there any rational tools to predict its trajectory, or are we left to just play guessing games?
From what I’ve observed, the fog starts to lift when you examine on-chain and technical indicators, while also factoring in the macro perspective. Let’s layer these three types of analysis in this article to see what picture emerges for Bitcoin’s next move.

Closing thoughts
Extreme greed, rising active addresses, and record hash rate
The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is currently at 78, indicating Extreme Greed, which often signals potential tops in the short term. However, sustained levels of extreme greed during bull markets often align with parabolic price increases before final peaks.
This typically precedes short-term pullbacks due to market exuberance, which appears to be what we’re witnessing now as Bitcoin’s price hovers around the $100K level.

The number of active addresses is increasing and, as of Dec. 8, stands at 855,153, suggesting heightened interest and usage of the Bitcoin network.
Number of active BTC addresses | Source: Glassnode
As of Dec. 9, 2024, Bitcoin’s hash rate is approximately 850.70 EH/s, reflecting a significant recovery from recent fluctuations but remaining below its all-time high of 949.98 EH/s, recorded on Nov. 26, 2024. While the current hash rate hasn’t yet reclaimed the ATH, this sustained strength reflects miner confidence and network security—long-term bullish signals. Bitcoin’s price tends to follow the hash rate; the more confident miners are about price appreciation, the less likely they are to sell.

Weekly Golden Cross signals bull market with $150K-$250K potential
The weekly Golden Cross, where the 50-week moving average crosses above the 200-week MA, is a highly significant signal for long-term investors because it often marks the start of major bull markets and the conclusion of prolonged bearish phases.
The previous instance of this signal occurred when Bitcoin recovered from the 2018 bear market and eventually surged to an all-time high of $69,000 in 2021.
Mirroring its behavior in previous bull cycles, this signal reappeared in early 2024 and preceded Bitcoin’s parabolic rise to its recent all-time high of $103,647. Previous bull cycles following weekly Golden Crosses have led to gains of 300%–600%.
If this pattern holds, Bitcoin could potentially reach $150,000 to $250,000 before the next major cycle correction. Meanwhile, the next Golden Cross is unlikely until 2026 or 2027, assuming Bitcoin undergoes a complete cycle of price appreciation, correction, and consolidation.

RSI signals overbought conditions, hints at pullback or consolidation
On the weekly timeframe, the Relative Strength Index is at 74.47, consistent with overbought conditions. However, this does not imply a trend reversal right away but rather reflects the possibility of a short-term pullback or a period of sideways price action.
In the past, many bull cycles saw similar RSI readings, followed by temporary pullbacks that were then succeeded by renewed rallies to higher highs.
In the 2021 bull cycle, the RSI reached similar levels multiple times before peaking above 90, after which Bitcoin experienced a significant correction. Assuming Bitcoin stays in the most recent consolidation range around $100K and the RSI retraces back to a healthier range of 60–65, the next leg upward could occur.
A healthy correction of 10%–20% or a sideways period would allow the markets to reset before experiencing sustained growth. For reference, a 10% correction from the all-time high of $103,647 would bring Bitcoin’s price to approximately $93,282.

Fibonacci levels and Bollinger Bands signal key support and potential cooling
Fibonacci retracement levels, used in technical analysis to identify potential support and resistance zones, help indicate where a price might retrace before continuing its trend. Based on the chart below:
Key Levels:
$71,858 (0.618):
Major retracement level, acting as a strong support zone (a 30.67% pullback from the all-time high of $103,647).
$103,135 (0.786):
Significant resistance zone, near the all-time high.
Bitcoin’s price is currently trading slightly below the upper Bollinger Band, signaling strong bullish momentum. However, this position also indicates potential overextension, as prices often retrace or consolidate when deviating significantly from the midline (20-week simple moving average, currently at $71,858).
A pullback to $71,858 or further consolidation near the current price of $99,249 would represent a normal cooling-off period within the Bollinger Band framework and prepare the market for potential further gains.

Visualizing Bitcoin’s market behavior through key indicators
To further visually represent Bitcoin’s market behavior, let’s look at this colored chart below. It includes a color-coded bar at the top that reflects RSI conditions. The currently visible purple and green color blocks suggest periods of oversold or bullish divergence, reflecting bullish momentum and aligning with RSI overbought levels.
The second bar shows market structure trends (e.g., ranging, bullish, or bearish). From the chart, we see green blocks that suggest the market is in a bullish phase, confirming breakout behavior.
Next, the main oscillator displays the Awesome Oscillator with divergences and pivot points, where the green peaks above zero and brown regions below confirm positive momentum and bullish pivots.
The secondary oscillator below the AO displays similar momentum indications, with positive bars (green above zero) suggesting accelerating upward momentum and a strong bullish bias.

Potential crypto space developments in 2025
Post-halving supply shock, increasing retail and institutional participation, institutional accumulation (companies like MicroStrategy and other corporate treasuries adopting Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset) could push demand for it to new highs.
The proportion of institutional investors will likely grow, stabilizing price movements but also making Bitcoin more correlated with traditional markets.
Bitcoin’s dominance (currently around 55%) could rise further as investors favor its “digital gold” narrative over altcoins, especially if regulatory scrutiny tightens around smaller tokens.
Bitcoin wallet growth will continue as adoption in emerging markets increases, with Bitcoin used as a hedge against local currency devaluation.
Major corporations could start settling cross-border transactions in Bitcoin, while in regions with high inflation or de-dollarization trends central banks may increase interest in Bitcoin as a reserve asset.
Countries like the U.S., the EU, and the UAE are likely to finalize crypto-friendly regulations, while other jurisdictions may clamp down on decentralized finance and self-custody to maintain control over financial systems.
Closing thoughts
With a loud explosion of excitement, Bitcoin shattered the $100K barrier, an achievement deemed nothing short of astonishing. Technical indicators, including the weekly Golden Cross and RSI, point toward the possibility of further growth, with projections suggesting a potential climb to $150K–$250K in this bull cycle.
However, a healthy period of consolidation or correction would likely provide a stronger foundation for future price action. By 2025, Bitcoin may achieve what was once considered nearly impossible—establishing itself as a major player in the global financial system.",https://crypto.news/from-100k-to-250k-analyzing-bitcoins-bull-market-signals/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-10 00:10:03.146533,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/c69/c694e3d19f40c6e8c3a6d40b78c548864cd6262d.webp,Successfully Scraped

news/analytics/30203270/,"Bitcoin sees another flash crash, leading to $1.52 billion cascade in crypto liquidations","The crypto market experienced a cascade of liquidations over the past 24 hours, totaling $1.52 billion, as Bitcoin (BTC) underwent yet another flash crash.
According to Coinglass data, longs made up the vast majority of the amount, with $1.39 billion liquidated across the market, while short liquidations accounted for $137 million of the total.
This marks the second consecutive week of intense market volatility, with altcoins taking the hardest hit. Over $759 million in liquidations occurred in the past hour alone, highlighting the speed and scale of the sell-off.
Intense volatility
Based on CryptoSlate data, Bitcoin’s price dropped sharply to an intraday low of $94,129 before partially recovering to trade at roughly $97,000 as of press time.
The sudden downturn triggered liquidations of $83.99 million in Bitcoin positions within the last four hours, with long traders accounting for the majority. The liquidation of leveraged positions added further downward pressure, exacerbating losses across the broader market.
Ethereum (ETH) bore the brunt of the sell-off among altcoins, with $134.50 million liquidated in the last four hours alone. The asset’s price fell to $3,510, marking a sharp drop from its recent highs, before recovering to the $3,700 level as of press time.
Dogecoin (DOGE) also saw substantial liquidations, with $51.55 million wiped out as the meme coin struggled to hold above critical support levels and fell to an intraday low of $0.38 before recovering to $0.422 as of press time.
The top altcoin losers included Solana (SOL), which saw $33.61 million in liquidations, and XRP, which recorded $33.78 million in wiped-out positions. The two coins fell to $203 and $2.01, respectively, before buyers stepped in to drive a recovery to $220 and $2.26 as of press time.
Cardano (ADA) also faced significant pressure, dropping below key psychological levels to $0.91. As of press time, it is still hovering around the $1 level.
Over-leveraged positions
The rapid sell-off was fueled by a combination of over-leveraged positions, weak sentiment, and cascading stop-loss orders.
Binance accounted for the largest share of liquidations, with $417.65 million in total liquidations over the past four hours. OKX followed with $224.76 million, while Bybit saw $207.16 million in wiped-out positions.
The most significant single liquidation event occurred on Binance’s ETHUSDT trading pair, totaling $19.69 million.
Despite the massive liquidations and intense volatility, the crypto Fear and Greed Index remains in Extreme Greed territory at 78.

On Monday, December 9, Coinbase support acknowledged a significant rise in account activity, including new and reactivated users. The exchange claimed that it has led to a 2-3x increase in fraudulent attempts.
Coinbase said that the platform’s automated fraud-prevention method restricted some accounts due to a sudden spike in activity after last month’s election.
“We’ve seen a surge of new users and old users re-activating their accounts post-election. Along with this surge, as is typical with surges, we’ve seen a 2-3x increase in fraudulent attempts. This is causing a minor increase in restricted accounts and elevated CX wait times.” Coinbase wrote on X (formerly Twitter).
However, the crypto community has challenged Coinbase’s narrative. Users appended notes to Coinbase’s posts on X, accusing the company of misleading the public and confirming that account restrictions are widespread.
“This is not FUD.  My coinbase account has been locked for months, basically because I used a VPN once.  Every time I provide what is asked for, something else is needed,” one user named Kyle Brehm replied.
Many shared experiences of prolonged account freezes, some lasting years, with little to no explanation from Coinbase. Several users claimed their accounts were restricted after using VPNs or flagged for extended manual reviews. Some had suspended trading and withdrawals for months.
“My Coinbase account has been under manual review for more than a week.  Cannot trade, cannot withdrawal, all I can do is look and ask Compliance and the Help desk to resolve this.  No response to my inquiries?,” one user wrote.
The issue has sparked significant outrage, with hundreds of comments flooding Coinbase’s posts. The staggering number of complaints highlights the severity of customer dissatisfaction.
“I think I speak for everyone when I say Coinbase has a customer support problem. They should have a 24/7 customer service support line you can call and speak to a real person in a timely fashion about your account and get an answer and resolution. It should’ve be that difficult,” influencer and Dogecoin millionaire Glauber Contessoto posted today.
Coinbase’s struggles are not limited to user grievances. Recently, the exchange exited Turkey, closing its operations after withdrawing its application with the country’s regulator. This move mirrors challenges faced by other exchanges like Binance and KuCoin in managing Turkey’s regulatory environment.
In October, Coinbase faced another setback when a phishing scam led to a $6.5 million loss. A hacker impersonating Coinbase Support stole funds, laundered them through TON-linked wallets, and vanished after deleting social media accounts.
Despite these challenges, Coinbase experienced a financially strong 2024. Increased crypto trading and potential regulatory shifts in the US propelled the exchange’s stock to a 97% year-to-date gain.
Also, its layer-2 network, Base, achieved notable milestones. Base surpassed six million daily transactions in Q3 and is currently ranking as the fifth-largest blockchain by total value locked (TVL).",https://beincrypto.com/coinbase-support-account-restrictions-backlash/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-09 22:10:04.425683,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/aaf/aafbbe718148e7cbf7046c6ae92d6c56d3dca316.jpg,Successfully Scraped
news/altcoins/30203116/,Ethereum researcher Max Resnick makes surprise jump to Solana,"This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions,
subscribe
.
Max Resnick, who has in recent months become one of Ethereum’s more notable online figures, has joined Solana core development shop Anza, he announced on X today.
Resnick previously worked at a Consensys subsidiary named Special Mechanisms Group and became known for his contrarian beliefs on Ethereum’s roadmap — arguing that some thinking around layer-2s was misguided and Ethereum should focus on scaling the base layer. In classic crypto fashion, much of Resnick’s rising star originated on X: Kaito AI ranks him as having the 40th-highest mindshare on Crypto Twitter over the past three months.
Consensys is a software company started by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin in 2014, and is perhaps best known for creating the MetaMask wallet. Anza is a Solana Labs spin-out that is responsible for continuing to develop the original Solana software.
The move was celebrated in the Solana world, where Resnick’s move to Solana was viewed as something of a coup. For Ethereum, Resnick doesn’t quite reach household name status like Justin Drake or Dankrad Feist do, but another high-profile defection following Resnick’s could certainly “raise some eyebrows,” said Paul Dylan-Ennis, a professor researching crypto at University College Dublin.
Resnick’s transition to Anza was helped along by Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, who encouraged the researcher to take the leap, Resnick shared with me today. The process started around three months ago. Resnick was also considering moves to Ethereum layer-2s or non-MetaMask crypto wallets.
Resnick said on X that he would be spending his first 100 days at Anza focusing on fee markets and consensus while getting up to speed on how Solana works at a core level. On a call today, Resnick added that his “moonshot” vision for Solana would be to add “multiple leaders” to the protocol.
On Ethereum and Solana today, one so-called leader is chosen to propose a block for validators to check. Under this model, the single leader has a “ton” of economic power which makes the protocols economically inefficient, Resnick said. Having multiple leaders compete to propose blocks could put downward pressure on how much economic value leaders can extract from validators.
Resnick credits himself with widening Ethereum’s overton window to allow for more serious conversations around how the layer-1 can scale, pointing out Ethereum Foundation researcher Dankrad Feist’s recent focus on scaling the L1 as an example.
But ultimately, Resnick sees Solana’s culture as more open to unconventional ideas, such as having multiple leaders — in comparison to Ethereum, which can tend to be bogged down by “political bullshit.”
“The ETH culture is really downstream of core development, and people who actually want to get things done are changing their personality, changing what they’re suggesting in order to make sure that they preserve political capital with the core dev community,” Resnick said.",https://blockworks.co/news/ethereum-researcher-joins-solana-anza?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-09 22:10:05.299265,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/f20/f20fbc5da1f85a20f36e34b75b2308180d1ed779.jpg,Successfully Scraped

US equities pulled back Monday, easing off last week’s gains as geopolitical tensions, a looming rate decision from the Fed and pending inflation data come to a head.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes dipped after Monday’s open, each trading 0.4% lower at 2:15 pm ET.
The share price of Nvidia — Big Tech’s darling that has surged almost 200% this year — slipped on Monday on news that China opened a probe into the chipmaker on suspicions of anti-monopoly law violations. The investigation comes days after President Joe Biden expanded limits on exports of semiconductors to China. This is part of an effort, the administration says, to limit China’s access to cutting-edge AI technology.
China last week also banned exports of three rare minerals and imposed new sanctions on US defense firms and executives. It’s starting to look like a full-on supply chain war in the final weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.
After opting to respond with parallel tariffs against the US during Trump’s first term, the Chinese government appears to be taking a more aggressive approach this time around. Trade War 2 is going to be a much dirtier fight.
Nvidia did not respond to Blockworks’s request for comment and has not made any public statements on the probe.

According to crypto data aggregator CoinGlass, there have been over $567 million in liquidations in the last 24 hours, most of them leveraged long positions in Bitcoin.
Closely followed analyst Rekt Capital tells his 519,000 followers on the social media platform X that the correction in altcoins has happened at a key point of resistance in the OTHERS chart, which tracks the total market of digital assets excluding the top 10 and is often used to gauge altcoin strength.
“Altcoin Market Cap has performed a Weekly Close above $425bn (black) for the 1st time since 2021
Black has always been a trouble area
That said, it’s likely Altcoin Market Cap will experience a much weaker rejection to prompt a much shallower retrace”

In another potential ominous sign for altcoins, the analyst also points out that Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D), which measures how much of the total crypto market cap belongs to BTC, is looking oversold based on the relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart.
An oversold RSI typically implies a bounce back for the asset – in this case for BTC.D which suggests pain for altcoins.

news/market/30202966/,Where is Binance Based? Longstanding HQ Controversy Remains Unresolved,"Deciding where to base its global headquarters has become a prolonged challenge for Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Despite years of signaling an imminent decision, the company remains in limbo, with its leadership citing complex factors such as governance, tax considerations, and talent availability.
In an interview at the Abu Dhabi Finance Week, as reported by
Reuters
, Binance CEO Richard Teng addressed the concern. He mentioned that the company was still working very hard on this. Teng termed the decision complicated with different complexities, highlighting the exchange's ongoing deliberations with multiple jurisdictions.
Corporate Governance
The delay in establishing a headquarters comes as Binance undertakes significant corporate restructuring, aiming to restore confidence after a turbulent year. Former CEO Changpeng Zhao, known as ""CZ,"" pleaded guilty to violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws earlier in 2023, a legal challenge that saw him spend months in jail.
Binance reportedly introduced its first-ever board of directors this year to strengthen transparency. The seven-member board includes three independent directors, marking a departure from its founder-driven past. The company is now led by a board of directors, signaling a shift from a founder-led entity.
In its quest for global legitimacy, Binance has secured 20 licenses and registrations worldwide, including in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The UAE has emerged as a potential hub, with Teng participating in high-profile events and Binance sponsoring a concurrent Bitcoin conference featuring notable speakers.
Additionally, Binance’s top executive cited tax laws and the ability to attract top talent as important in making this decision. These factors, coupled with ongoing discussions in various regions, are shaping the trajectory of the final decision.
Top Performance in November
Bitcoin recently hit a record high above $100,000, driven by speculation that the U.S. could adopt a friendlier regulatory stance under President-elect Donald Trump.
If the US embraces a strategic Bitcoin reserve, Teng anticipates a ripple effect, with other nations following suit. The crypto market rally in November was reflected in market activity statistics, including spot volumes of major cryptocurrency exchanges.
Finance Magnates Intelligence’s analysis highlighted that market turnover increased by an average of 180% compared to the prior month and year.
Binance dominated the top 10 crypto exchanges with a 49% market share, followed by Upbit at 12%. Bybit, Coinbase, and OKX closed the top five list with 12%, 11%, and 9%, respectively.

news/bitcoin/30202938/,Former US Treasury Secretary Makes Shocking Remarks About Trump’s Bitcoin Plans,"President-elect Donald Trump’s proposal to create a strategic national Bitcoin reserve has sparked controversy, with former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers calling the idea “crazy” and accusing Trump of pandering to crypto industry donors.
Speaking to Bloomberg TV, Summers, who oversaw the US national gold reserve under President Bill Clinton, described the concept as impractical and unnecessary.
“The idea that we should have some kind of national Bitcoin reserve is crazy,” Summers said. “Unlike gold or oil, which have tangible uses and strategic value, Bitcoin is essentially an unproductive inventory.”
Summers argued that the proposal lacked a clear purpose and appeared to appeal to special interests. “There is no reason to do this other than to please the generous special interests who contributed to the campaign,” Summers added.
The plan has its roots in promises made at a Bitcoin conference in July, when Trump vowed to fire Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler and floated the idea of a Bitcoin reserve. Trump claimed such a move was necessary to counter geopolitical rivals, saying, “If we don’t do it, China and others will.”
Crypto-friendly Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced a bill supporting the initiative, proposing that the U.S. government purchase 1 million Bitcoins over five years, about 5% of the global supply. At current market prices, such a reserve would cost about $100 billion. Proponents argue that the reserve could reduce the national debt and diversify government assets to strengthen the dollar.

However, its RSI is now at 46, a significant drop from the overbought level above 70 that was seen between November 29 and December 3, when XRP peaked around $2.90, its highest level since 2018.
This decline suggests that the bullish momentum has cooled, and the market sentiment is now neutral or slightly bearish. As a result, XRP could face a period of consolidation or mild downward pressure before any potential recovery.
XRP RSI Is Neutral After Consecutive Days Above 70
XRP RSI is currently at 46, a significant drop from the overbought level above 70 between November 29 and December 3, when its price peaked around $2.9, the highest since 2018.
The decline in RSI suggests that the recent bullish momentum has cooled off, and the market may now be in a neutral or slightly bearish phase.
XRP RSI. Source: TradingView
RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It ranges from 0 to 100, with values above 70 typically indicating an overbought condition, while values below 30 suggest oversold conditions.
With XRP’s RSI at 46, it indicates that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a neutral market sentiment. If this trend continues, Ripple price may experience a period of consolidation or mild downward pressure before a potential recovery.
Ripple CMF Is Now Around 0
XRP’s CMF is currently at -0.01, following a brief positive reading of 0.04 just a few hours ago. The indicator reached a negative peak of -0.25 on December 6, after remaining positive between November 29 and December 5.
This shift in the CMF suggests that XRP next movements are still uncertain, and the asset is struggling to maintain upward momentum.
XRP CMF. Source: TradingView
CMF, or Chaikin Money Flow, measures the accumulation and distribution of an asset over a specific period, taking into account both price and volume. It ranges from -1 to +1, with values above 0 indicating accumulation (buying pressure) and values below 0 indicating distribution (selling pressure).
The current CMF of -0.01 indicates a weak selling pressure, suggesting that while there was an attempt to reverse the downtrend, it was not strong enough to sustain the positive momentum. If this trend continues, it could indicate further downward pressure for XRP price in the near term.
XRP Price Prediction: Can Ripple Go Below $2?
Ripple EMA lines remain bullish, with short-term lines positioned above the long-term ones, suggesting an overall upward trend.
However, the current price is below the shortest line, indicating that the trend may be shifting and the bullish momentum could be weakening.

If a strong downtrend develops, XRP price could test the support at $2.16, and if that level fails to hold, it could fall as low as $1.63, potentially marking a 32% correction.
On the other hand, if Ripple price regains its upward momentum, following the more than 330% surge in the last 30 days, it could rise to retest $2.90 and potentially push toward $3, a level not seen since January 7, 2018.",https://beincrypto.com/ripple-xrp-price-faces-uncertain-after-6-year-highs/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-09 22:10:07.943383,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/0a4/0a4d0398cc8f2a6746eb1f46519ec9df75e0b16e.jpg,Successfully Scraped

.
MicroStrategy has bought more bitcoin, and an analyst team has upped its Coinbase stock price target. But first a look at bitcoin miners, which are increasingly raising capital via convertible note issuances.
Bitdeer last month unveiled a $360 million convertible senior notes offering. Then last week, Marathon Digital, Core Scientific and Iris Energy initiated convertible notes offerings — amounting to $850 million, $550 million and $400 million, respectively.
Seven publicly traded BTC miners and data center companies have raised a combined $5.2 billion via convertible notes since June, according to data compiled by TheMinerMag. About 70% of that came in the last four weeks.
That MinerMag stat doesn’t include the most recent issuance: Riot Platforms on Monday proposed a $500 million convertible notes offering.
These moves reflect mining firms capitalizing on growing bullish sentiment around bitcoin among institutional investors, BlocksBridge Consulting founder Nishant Sharma told me.
“This trend is likely to continue, as we’re in the early stages of a new crypto bull run,” he added. Bitcoin’s price was about $98,000 at 2 pm ET Monday — down 3% from 24 hours ago.
Bitdeer noted the proceeds of its offering would go toward data center expansion, as well as ASIC-based mining rig development and manufacturing.
The firm’s stock has surged 86% over the past month and more than 27% during last Friday’s trading session alone, Benchmark’s Mark Palmer wrote in a Monday research note. Last week’s rally came after the company boosted its SEALMINER A2 mining rig hashrate projection in 2025 from 18 exahash per second (EH/s) to 35 EH/s.
Palmer raised his Bitdeer stock price target from $16 to $29 — noting “the company’s multifaceted business model provides investors with multiple ways to realize upside.”
Marathon and Riot specifically mentioned having their eye on using the capital to buy more BTC. MARA and RIOT share prices are down 3% and down 23%, respectively, over the past month.
Sharma said it wouldn’t surprise him to see Marathon aggressively follow the “compelling precedent” set by MicroStrategy, noting MARA and competitor CleanSpark, for example, are well-positioned to take “decisive action” on both mining and “hodling.”
Marathon holds 34,959 BTC, while CleanSpark has 9,297 bitcoins. Hut 8 Mining has 9,122 BTC and said it would use some proceeds from its latest at-the-market (ATM) and stock repurchase programs to purchase more bitcoin “as a strategic reserve asset.”
As teased at the top, MicroStrategy bought another 21,550 bitcoins (for about $2.1 billion in cash) between Dec. 2 and 8, bringing its total pile to 423,650 BTC.
MSTR stock was down more than 4% at 2 pm ET — a bit more than Monday’s BTC price decline.
Coinbase’s share price had dipped 7% Monday by that time, to about $318. Still, Needham analysts John Todaro and Brian Vieten on Monday raised their COIN price target from $375 to $420, noting the crypto exchange is on track (in December) to have its best volumes month since May 2021.",https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-miner-convertible-note-raises?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-09 22:10:08.334368,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/08e/08e132dc99213a318652fb7417f4c03565b9e1a4.jpg,Successfully Scraped
news/finance/30202126/,Why On-Chain Lending Redefines Financial Innovation,"The financial world has witnessed transformative moments over the centuries: the advent of central banking in the 1600s created modern monetary systems, and the introduction of derivatives in the 1970s opened up new avenues for risk management and financial growth. Today, another such innovation is unfolding—on-chain lending, which has the potential to disrupt traditional finance at its core. Visionaries like Balaji Srinivasan have already recognized its significance, dubbing it the “killer blockchain app” with transformative implications.
On-Chain Lending as a Killer App
Balaji Srinivasan, a leading tech entrepreneur, recently amplified the importance of on-chain lending by calling it the most significant financial development since central banking and derivatives.
It replaces central banking with decentralized banking.
Rather than setting interest rates by fiat, rates get set by markets.
Example below. Lenders set a price, aka an interest rate. And borrowers decide to borrow at that rate.
No Fed.
No centralized rates.
Just markets. https://t.co/Mki9xvaAzN pic.twitter.com/jjh6l5BDbY
— Balaji (@balajis) December 8, 2024
His bold comparison highlights the magnitude of this innovation. Central banking revolutionized how nations managed money; derivatives reshaped risk management and speculation. On-chain lending now stands at the intersection of decentralization and finance, promising a system that’s transparent, efficient, and accessible to billions worldwide.
Traditional Lending vs. On-Chain Lending
To understand the importance of on-chain lending, it’s useful to first examine its predecessor: centralized lending. Platforms like Bitfinex allow users to lend and borrow funds via peer-to-peer mechanisms. For instance, Bitfinex’s funding book shows interest rates for USD funding ranging from 0.017% to 0.025%. While this system is functional, it is far from revolutionary. Centralized platforms rely on intermediaries, limiting transparency and driving up costs.

On-chain lending flips this model entirely. Powered by blockchain and smart contracts, it removes the need for middlemen, automating the lending process. Users can directly interact in a decentralized environment, ensuring trustless, borderless transactions with significantly lower fees. Moreover, on-chain lending democratizes access to financial tools, offering opportunities to individuals who might otherwise be excluded from traditional banking.
Why On-Chain Lending is a Game-Changer
On-chain lending brings several unprecedented advantages to the table:
Decentralization:
No intermediaries means reduced costs and fewer barriers to entry.
Accessibility:
On-chain lending is open to anyone with an internet connection, including the unbanked.
Transparency:
Transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring trust and eliminating opacity.
Speed:
Real-time settlements streamline financial processes.
This innovation mirrors the impact of derivatives. Just as derivatives introduced new methods for managing risk and maximizing returns, on-chain lending is unlocking financial opportunities for millions, from yield farming to decentralized credit systems.
Challenges and the Path Forward
Despite its promise, on-chain lending faces significant hurdles. Regulatory uncertainties loom large, with governments struggling to define its place in the financial ecosystem. Additionally, vulnerabilities in smart contracts pose security risks, while blockchain scalability remains an ongoing concern.
However, these challenges are not insurmountable. With advancements in technology and regulatory clarity, on-chain lending could realize its potential and reshape global finance.
On-chain lending is not just another blockchain application; it is a paradigm shift in how we think about finance. Like central banking and derivatives before it, this innovation has the power to redefine markets, empower individuals, and make financial systems more equitable. As Balaji aptly put it, most people don’t yet realize the magnitude of this revolution—but they will soon.",https://www.cryptonewsz.com/why-on-chain-lending-financial-innovation/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-09 22:10:08.714815,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/3a7/3a76d6d0eb665d838f8de397029dce93256e28a8.png,Successfully Scraped

Crypto Market Performance in November 2024
In November 2024, the cryptocurrency market reached unprecedented heights, with total market capitalization surging to a record US$3.47 trillion. This growth was fueled by Bitcoin's remarkable rally to over US$100,000 and significant institutional participation, evidenced by seven consecutive weeks of positive spot ETF inflows totaling over US$6.5 billion for the month. The Federal Reserve's November 7 rate cut to 4.5%-4.75% bolstered confidence in risk-on assets, while the announcement of SEC Chair Gary Gensler's resignation heightened speculation about potential regulatory reforms favorable to digital assets.
BTC and ETH spot ETFs led the charge, breaking inflow records and driving cumulative net inflows to over US$30 billion and US$577 million, respectively. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and Grayscale's Ether ETF emerged as market leaders, underlining institutional appetite for crypto.
Altcoins also saw a resurgence, with CoinMarketCap's Altcoin Season Index climbing from 27 to 70 and total market cap rising by US$470 billion month-over-month. Solana outpaced Ethereum in daily fees, driven by explosive DEX activity exceeding US$120 billion, though controversy marred the memecoin trading frenzy. Ethereum reclaimed dominance in stablecoin liquidity, surpassing Tron as the leading network for USDT with a 31.4% supply increase to US$61.8 billion.

In November 2024, XRP led the cryptocurrency market with a staggering 362.3% gain, fueled by the resignation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler and heightened optimism about Ripple’s regulatory prospects. The filing of an XRP exchange-traded product (ETP) by WisdomTree further solidified investor confidence.
ADA followed closely with a 216% surge, driven by the Glacier Airdrop's $NIGHT token allocation to ADA holders and Cardano’s partnership with BitcoinOS to leverage Bitcoin's liquidity. Speculation about Charles Hoskinson's discussions with the Trump administration added to ADA’s momentum.
DOGE saw a 160.4% rise, catalyzed by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy's ""Department of Government Efficiency"" (D.O.G.E.) initiative, with speculation about integration into social media platforms adding to the buzz. SHIB also performed well, climbing 70.7%, boosted by growing regulatory optimism and memecoin enthusiasm.
ETH gained 45.1%, supported by institutional inflows, the Federal Reserve’s rate cut, and increasing adoption of layer-2 solutions that improve scalability. Bitcoin rose 36.9%, driven by robust ETF inflows averaging US$1.8B weekly and optimism around regulatory changes following the U.S. presidential election. TON (+33.3%), TRX (+24.7%), and BNB (+10.8%) achieved more modest gains but also benefited from regulatory optimism and platform-specific developments. Notably, BNB’s growth was linked to the success of its BNB Greenfield initiative, which attracted major projects like Limewire.
Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
In November 2024, DeFi Total Value Locked (TVL) surged by 33.7%, reflecting sustained on-chain momentum and heightened anticipation of regulatory clarity. Solana, Base, and Sui led the way with impressive TVL growth rates of 43.4%, 32.9%, and 54.0%, respectively. Solana reached a record-high US$8.8B in TVL, bolstered by institutional and retail capital inflows. Key contributors included liquid staking protocols like Jito, Sanctum, and Binance Staked Sol (BNSOL), alongside liquidity providers Drift and Raydium, which supported the network's expanding on-chain volumes. The rise of real-world assets (RWA) further drove growth, with Chainlink seeing developer activity skyrocket by 14,450% as its infrastructure bridged blockchain networks with real-world data.
Base's DeFi TVL climbed to US$3.4B, a 33.4% increase, fueled by robust user participation in lending and borrowing markets. Uniswap’s TVL soared by 55.4% due to its seamless integration with Base and Arbitrum, solidifying its dominance in liquidity provision. The network also set a record with over 9.2 million daily transactions, emphasizing its scalability. Meanwhile, Sui achieved a record US$1.6B in TVL, driven by strong capital rotation into Sui-based chains. Standout protocols included Suilend, with an 86.5% TVL growth, and projects like Navi Protocol, Cetus AMM, and Scallop Lend, which demonstrated the network's growing appeal in DeFi innovation.

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)
Monthly NFT trading volume
In November, the NFT market saw a 57.6% surge in total sales volume, surpassing US$0.5B for ETH NFTs. However, the number of unique buyers and sellers dropped by 24.7%, indicating consolidation among fewer, higher-value transactions. Oversaturation persisted, with some 98% of NFT projects launched this year being unprofitable, highlighting challenges in profitability and sustained market engagement. Ethereum collections saw mixed results, with CryptoPunks leading at 141.4% growth, while Doodles rebounded with an impressive 584.0% increase. Innovative projects like Courtyard.io continued steady activity, averaging 3,500 daily sales.
Bitcoin NFTs experienced a 220% jump in volume, driven by enthusiasm for Ordinals and the BRC-20 protocol, with leading collections such as ArtBlock and NodeMonkes posting significant gains. Other chains, including Solana (+19.3%), Polygon (+28.6%), and BNB Chain (+48.1%), also reported notable growth. These trends reflect renewed optimism in the broader crypto market, despite persistent challenges in sustaining broad engagement and profitability.

news/analytics/30202080/,3 Key Reasons Why Chainlink Price Could Hit $30 This Week,"During Monday’s market session, the crypto market witnessed a notable downtick as Bitcoin dived 3.3% to plunge below the $100k mark. The BTC’s struggle to sustain above this psychological level has initiated a consolidation phase in the altcoin market. Amid the uncertainty, the Chainlink price revealed the formation’s well-known bull-flag pattern, signaling the potential for $30 soon.
Currently, the LINK price exchanges hands at $24.3, with an intraday loss of 6.6%. According to Coingecko, the global crypto market cap is at $3.86 Trillion, with an intraday gain of 0.8%. Meanwhile, the 24-hour trading volume is at $393 Billion.
Key Highlights:
The chainlink price is 12% short from a bullish breakout from the bull-flag pattern.
LINK coin consolidation experiencing whale buying signals the potential for an extended uptrend.
The LINK buyers could witness an overhead supply pressure at $26.9 followed by $30 levels.
Chainlink Ecosystem Flourishes with Surge in User Engagement
Chainlink, a decentralized Oracle network, has reported significant growth in its daily active addresses. According to data from IntoTheBlock, the platform is now averaging 8.22k active addresses daily, marking a staggering 142% increase compared to its performance a month ago.
This surge highlights a renewed interest in Chainlink’s ecosystem and indicates a robust rise in user engagement, signaling a positive trend for the project’s future trajectory.

Whale Accumulation Highlights Confidence in Chainlink Price Breakout

According to onchain data tracker Lookonchain, a crypto whale on Sunday bought 390,230 LINK( worth approximately $9.68M ) from Binance exchange and deposited it to leading protocol AAVE.
Later, this large holder borrowed 4 Million USDT from AAVE and deposited it to Binance, potentially to buy more LINK tokens. This acclimation highlights the whale’s confidence in LINK’s future momentum.
Historically, whale accumulation has coincided with market reversal or key breakout, indicating a dynamic moving near for chainlink price.

Bull-Flag Formation Hints at LINK Rally to $36
Since last weekend, the Chainlink price has resonated within $27 and $22.7 horizontal levels. While the consolidation followed BTC’s sideways action below $100k, the LINK coin projecting rejection candles on either side indicates no clear initiation from buyers or sellers.
However, the altcoin revealed this lateral movement as the formation of a bull-flag pattern in a 4-hour chart. Theoretically, the pattern offers a temporary breather for buyers to rebuild exhausted momentum.

Thus, a potential breakout from the pattern overhead resistance will accelerate the buying pressure and drive a rally to $30, followed by the $36 level.",https://www.cryptonewsz.com/3-key-chainlink-price-30-week/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-09 22:10:09.638995,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/38b/38b67c59f88311f1864fff8d3e836ef0260264b2.webp,Successfully Scraped
news/finance/30202026/,"China's ""Moderately Loose"" Policy: What It Means for Bitcoin","For the first time since 2010, China has announced a shift toward a “moderately loose” monetary policy, aiming to revive its sluggish economy. The move, declared by the Communist Party’s Politburo, signals a departure from its traditionally tight fiscal stance. This development could have broader implications for global financial markets — and notably, for Bitcoin.
What Is China’s “Moderately Loose” Policy?
China’s “moderately loose” policy aims to increase liquidity in its financial system, boost consumer demand, and support the struggling property sector. The policy shift follows signs of economic distress, including slowing GDP growth, deflationary risks, and a real estate market on the brink of collapse.
The approach includes measures such as cutting interest rates, reducing reserve requirements for banks, and injecting liquidity into the economy through open market operations. This increased cash flow encourages borrowing and spending, stimulating growth. Analysts see the move as a clear signal that China is ready to prioritize economic expansion over financial stability, a stance it hasn’t taken since the 2008 financial crisis.
Chinese markets have already responded. Stocks and bonds surged after the announcement, with renewed investor optimism about the government’s ability to reinvigorate economic growth. The real estate sector, in particular, welcomed the news, as property developers are expected to receive financial relief, potentially averting defaults.
What It Means for Bitcoin
Historically, monetary easing leads to an influx of liquidity in financial markets, which often finds its way into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, often referred to as “digital gold,” typically benefits from such conditions. The increased availability of capital can prompt investors to seek higher returns, making Bitcoin an attractive option.
Moreover, Bitcoin’s narrative as a hedge against fiat devaluation strengthens when major economies flood their systems with cash. While China has strict crypto regulations, including a 2021 ban on crypto trading and mining, demand for Bitcoin among Chinese citizens has never fully disappeared. Despite bans, many investors access crypto markets via offshore exchanges and decentralized platforms.
Prominent figures like BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes argue that China’s monetary “chemotherapy” could fuel demand for Bitcoin. He predicts that wealthy Chinese investors will seek to hedge against yuan devaluation, just as they did during previous liquidity expansions.
While it remains unclear how much capital will flow into Bitcoin due to China’s policy shift, the move has rekindled interest in alternative assets. For Bitcoin holders, this could signal a renewed bullish narrative as global liquidity conditions shift in their favor.",https://www.cryptonewsz.com/china-monetary-policy-impact-on-bitcoin/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-09 22:10:10.428999,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/74f/74fa0121d1b45bd27f30c5b5ae078fe3ac6d3f8e.webp,Successfully Scraped
news/altcoins/30202814/,Ethereum Whale Makes $1 Million Profit from $CULT Token Sniping,"In a significant example of precise high-stakes trading in the crypto market, an Ethereum whale has carried out a lucrative snipe on the $CULT coin. As per Lookonchain, the whale obtained a net profit of up to $1M in a short period from $CULT sniping, highlighting the surging sophistication by the traders in the DeFi sector.
Someone used 500 $ETH($1.99M) to snipe 467.64M $CULT and currently has a profit of ~$1M.
The sniper used 100 $ETH($398K) as a bribe fee and successfully became the first one to buy $CULT!
So far, he has sold 267.64M $CULT for 432 $ETH($1.72M), leaving 200M $CULT($1.32M).… pic.twitter.com/n7wbkKaRSg
— Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 9, 2024
Ethereum Whale Snipes on $CULT to Pocket $1M with 500 $ETH
Lookonchain mentioned that the whale’s journey to successfully snipe $CULT for $1M in profit started with 500 $ETH. The whale deployed these $ETH tokens, with a value of up to $1.99M, to get 467.64M $CULT coins. A key aspect of this maneuver’s success was the utilization of a substantial 100 $ETH (equaling $398,000) as a bribe fee. This ensured the priority of their transfer in execution before the others. The respective strategic development permitted the trader to dominate status in the case of $CULT.
After the accumulation, the above-mentioned wale started offloading portions of the token holdings. In this respect, the whale leveraged the favorable price developments. Hence, they offloaded 267.64M $CULT coins for 432 $ETH (accounting for $1.72M). This partial offloading locked in enormous profits and left the whale with 200M $CULT coins. These tokens currently have a value of $1.32M.
The Incident Highlights the Precise Decision Making and High-Stakes Trading
This trade emphasizes high-stakes trading as well as decision-making. In this case, meticulous planning is used to mitigate the huge risk of dropping a massive capital amount. In addition to this, there is a requirement for deep knowledge of the overall market dynamics. With the payment of the bribe fee, the respective whale effectively secured a dominant status in $CULT before likely price inflation due to other buyers. According to Lookonchain, this $CULT snipe offers a reminder of the unpredictable and dynamic nature of the crypto sector.",https://blockchainreporter.net/ethereum-whale-makes-1-million-profit-from-cult-token-sniping/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-09 22:10:10.844299,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/404/404c2b964fc2ab9ad70accacb762d79a3700bfb3.webp,Successfully Scraped
news/analytics/30202829/,"Solana (SOL) Price Down 15% From All-Time High, More Declines Possible","Solana (SOL) price is currently trading roughly 15% below its all-time high reached on November 22, while its market cap it’s now at $107 billion, surpassing tech giant Xiaomi. Despite a positive BBTrend on December 8, indicating some upward momentum, it has since weakened and is now at 0.66, suggesting that the trend could reverse soon.
Meanwhile, SOL’s DMI chart shows an increasing ADX of 26.2, signaling that the strength of the trend is rising, although the negative momentum remains dominant. With the EMA lines also turning bearish, SOL price could face further declines, potentially testing support levels as low as $215 in the near term.
SOL BBTrend Is Positive, But That Could Change Soon
After staying negative between November 27 and December 6, Solana BBTrend turned positive again, peaking at 2.8 on December 8.
However, it is currently at 0.66, suggesting that the positive trend is weakening.
SOL BBTrend. Source: TradingView
BBTrend is a technical indicator derived from Bollinger Bands. It measures the strength and direction of a trend. A positive BBTrend value suggests upward momentum, while a negative value indicates downward momentum.
Although SOL’s BBTrend was positive recently, its current decline implies that the trend may not have enough strength to sustain upward movement. If BBTrend turns negative again, it could signal a potential downtrend for SOL, possibly leading to further price declines.
Solana Downtrend Turned Strong But Appears To Have Stabilized
Solana DMI chart shows its ADX is currently at 26.2, up from around 16 just a day ago.
This indicates that the strength of the trend is increasing, suggesting that a more defined movement is starting to form.
SOL DMI. Source: TradingView
ADX (Average Directional Index) is a technical indicator used to measure the strength of a trend, regardless of its direction. It ranges from 0 to 100, with values above 25 indicating a strong trend, while values below 20 suggest a weak trend. Currently, SOL’s ADX at 26.2 shows that the trend is gaining strength.
Despite this, SOL is in a downtrend as its D+ (positive directional indicator) is at 8.6, while D- (negative directional indicator) is at 25.8. Although D- has stabilized after reaching 25, it still indicates that the negative momentum is dominant, suggesting that SOL could continue its downtrend unless a shift in momentum occurs.
SOL Price Prediction: Will SOL Fall To $215 In December?
SOL’s EMA lines are currently showing a bearish trend, with short-term lines trending down and the price positioned below them. One of the short-term lines has just crossed a long-term line, suggesting further downward pressure.
SOL Price Analysis. Source:
TradingView
If this trend continues, Solana price could test the support at $221, and if that level fails to hold, the price might drop as low as $215.
However, if the uptrend regains strength, SOL price could recover and rise to test the resistance at $246, indicating a potential 10% upside from its current level, especially if some of its biggest applications, such as Pumpfun and Raydium, continue to attract users and volume.",https://beincrypto.com/solana-sol-price-down-from-all-time-high-more-declines/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-09 22:10:11.229223,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/d15/d158bff6effee602a0229ba74511ad640426b831.jpg,Successfully Scraped
news/legal/30202826/,Ripple CEO Claps Back at Former SEC Official,"Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has addressed recent comments made by former SEC official John Reed Stark during a recent ""60 Minutes"" episode, arguing that his points were ""provably false.""
Stark, who made an appearance on the program together with Garlinghouse, was highly critical of cryptocurrencies, stating that they are ""a scourge"" for society while also claiming that crypto tokens are securities.
His harsh words attracted some backlash within the XRP community, with Garlinghouse himself taking aim at Stark by calling him a ""shill"" for SEC Chair Gary Gensler.
In response, Garlinghouse clarified that he has never actually spoken with Gensler. ""I’ve never spoken, met or even been in the same room as Gary Gensler and I look forward to my former boss Paul Atkins taking over as SEC Chair and reversing a lot of the non-crypto initiatives and cases that occurred during Chair Gensler’s reign,"" Stark said in a social media post.
Stark has also predicted that Atkins, a pro-crypto libertarian, could become the greatest SEC Chair in history.
In turn, Garlinghouse said that Gensler sounded ""an awful lot"" like the SEC boss with his anti-crypto statements. ""These are all PROVABLY false and 60Minutes could have easily fact checked before including them,"" he said in response. Garlinghouse added that the SEC failing to protect investors was the actual of society.
As
reported by U.Today
, Garlinghouse also said that ""60 Minutes"" cut out a significant portion of his interview, including the part about XRP not being a security.",https://u.today/ripple-ceo-claps-back-at-former-sec-official?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-09 22:10:11.986940,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/375/3750243ec799ea925646689293e3e68d92a9589a.jpg,Successfully Scraped
news/market/30202268/,PayPal Integrated into Paybis as Trump Appoints David Sacks AI & Crypto Czar,"Paybis, a cryptocurrency exchange and onramp provider, has integrated PayPal, a widely used online payment system, into its platform to enhance security, accessibility, and ease of use for crypto transactions.
At the same time, US President-elect Donald Trump announced the appointment of former PayPal Chief Operating Officer, David Sacks, as his ""White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.""
Paybis Integrates PayPal for Crypto
The service is currently available in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK, excluding Hungary, Croatia, and Iceland. Paybis plans to expand to new regions based on market demand and regulatory compliance.
This integration allows users to tap into PayPal's 430 million global users and its familiar interface, simplifying crypto purchases for newcomers.
Compared to traditional payment methods like credit and debit cards, PayPal's infrastructure offers higher reliability and a better transaction success rate, often avoiding the fraud checks, user errors, and bank declines that hinder other methods. This contributes to increased user confidence when buying cryptocurrencies on Paybis.
Trump Claims Credit for Bitcoin Surge
The appointment of Sacks is part of Trump's effort to reshape US policy on digital currency. His incoming administration, including officials from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is expected to influence the future of US cryptocurrency policy.
Trump’s tech supporters advocate for minimal regulation in sectors like artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency, arguing that excessive rules could stifle innovation.
Bitcoin surpassed the $100,000 all-time price level last week, a milestone that stirred the crypto community and elicited a response from President-elect Trump, as reported by Finance Magnates.
Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, to claim credit for the achievement, which he suggested was partly driven by his appointment of pro-crypto SEC chair, Paul Atkins.
“CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU’RE WELCOME!!! Together, we will Make America Great Again!” Trump wrote, attributing the cryptocurrency’s historic surge to his administration's pro-crypto approach.",https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/paypal-integrated-into-paybis-as-trump-appoints-david-sacks-ai-crypto-czar/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-09 22:10:12.382931,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/d50/d50a5d3114f95926641bc86ccfb52843a866f18a.jpg,Successfully Scraped
news/ethereum/30202811/,Whale doubles down on ETH with $7m buy,"On-chain data reveals that a whale has increased their Eehereum holdings with a substantial purchase.
According to Lookonchain, the whale, who already held millions of dollars worth of Ethereum (ETH) accumulated over recent months, made a 1,800 ETH purchase valued at $7 million. This acquisition occurred as the price of Ether hovered near $3,900.
Lookonchain shared the whale’s transaction via a post on X.
This whale has been actively accumulating Ethereum since May 24, amassing 39,600 ETH in total over several months. With the recent addition, the total investment value has reached approximately $99 million, bringing the whale’s average purchase price to $2,487 per coin.

Ethereum reached $4k as retail accumulation strengthens
The whale’s bullish view on the altcoin saw them acquire over 6,800 ETH in four transactions in the past four months. Overall, the acquisitions currently put their unrealized profit at $54 million.
Something noteworthy about this whale is that they held as some took a bearish view with huge net inflows in September. As Ether price fell to lows of $2,200, data from IntoTheBlock showed whales sent more than $493 million in a week.
Ethereum has since witnessed a recovery to above $4,067 as bulls took control following Trump’s win.
Analysts at Singapore-based QCP Capital say Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH are both at key levels despite the profit-taking deals at the critical $100K and $4k respectively. Options data for the 27 Dec. 2024 expiry indicates levels that “align with the highest open interest,” the analysts wrote.
Pointing to a potential squeeze higher, QCP analysts noted:
“History says ETH hits new highs in January post-halving. Options markets agree, where #ETH risk reversals favor calls starting in January.”

news/legal/30202879/,"SBF Working on Million-Dollar Memoir, FTX Victims to Get Royalty","Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the former billionaire and cofounder of the collapsed FTX crypto exchange, is reportedly drafting a prison memoir while serving a 25-year sentence at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC). Bankman-Fried, who was convicted of fraud, has shared excerpts of his writings through his father, Joe Bankman, aiming to find a publisher for the project.
What will Happen to Royalties From FTX Founder’s Memoir?
Despite the memoir’s potential to secure a lucrative advance—estimated by a literary agent at seven figures—Bankman-Fried will not profit. As part of his sentencing, he faces an $11 billion forfeiture, which will prioritize compensating the FTX crypto exchange‘s victims. “The billions being restored during the bankruptcy process do not count,” a source noted.
The diary provides an intimate view of life behind bars and Bankman-Fried’s adaptation to harsh prison conditions. Among his grievances is the absence of basic comforts like pillows. “What the actual [expletive], we’re not allowed to have pillows? Are we allowed to sleep?” he wrote, according to a Forbes report.
Here, SBF is described how he traded two muffins for a makeshift pillow crafted from torn mattress stuffing. He also recounts losing the item during a cell raid. “I lost my pillow tonight. I’m now using towels and prison jumpsuits, but it doesn’t work. My neck already hurts.”

The writings delve into his relationships with fellow inmates, including one he nicknames “Harry,” a sports enthusiast who proposed a flawed betting strategy that Bankman-Fried calls “the gambler’s fallacy.” Reflecting on his cellmates’ behavior, he writes, “Most people become innies. They will go to war over a banana and trade everything to get high one more time.”
Closer Look at SBF’s Diary
He also explores the psychological toll of confinement. SBF remarked, “How can you be true to your true self when your true self has been deemed a danger to society so great you need to be locked in a cage?”
A notable section of the diary addresses the prevalence of a smuggled drug referred to as “deuce,” which SBF claims turns users into “zombies.” While denying any personal use, he describes the drug’s impact on prison life, including crackdowns by guards.
The diary also reflects on SBF’s childhood, highlighting a deep attachment to a stuffed dog named “Manfred,” which he often used as a pillow. “Ever since I got a stuffed dog when I was two years old, I’ve slept with him nearly every night of my life.”
Bankman-Fried’s motivations for publishing the memoir remain unclear. His father has enlisted the help of Walter Pavlo, a white-collar crime expert, to assist with the project.

news/analytics/30203079/,Crypto Crumbles in Broad Selloff Led 20% Declines Across Numerous Altcoins,"A slow bleed in crypto since late in the weekend accelerated into the early evening U.S. hours on Monday, leaving nearly the entirety of the sector sharply lower.
With prices in quick retreat, bitcoin (BTC) at press time had fallen back to just above $95,000, down about 5% over the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH) was down 10% to $3,590.
The broader CoinDesk 20 Index was lower by more than 8% over the same time frame, led by roughly 20% dives for Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), and XRP (XRP).
Over $750 million worth of leveraged derivatives positions were liquidated across all digital assets over the past day, CoinGlass data shows, the ovewhelming majority of which were bullish bets. That puts today's flush almost on par with the August 5 crash and just trailing last Thursday's wild swing when BTC plunged to $90,000 from above $100,000.

news/mining/30202854/,Bitmain launches US production line to outmaneuver geopolitical trade tensions,"Bitcoin mining hardware giant Bitmain announced the launch of a new US-based production line, a strategic move aimed at mitigating delays caused by customs holds and navigating escalating trade tensions.
In a Dec. 9 statement, Bitmain highlighted the benefits of local production, stating:
“This strategic move aims to provide faster response times and more efficient services to North American customers.”
The first batch of US-made Antminer S21 Pro units is set to be delivered this December.
The decision follows reports of significant hold-ups by the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which has detained shipments of Bitmain’s Antminer devices over national security concerns linked to the company’s supply chain.
Supply chain challenges
The launch of US operations follows significant disruptions for American miners, who have faced delays of up to two months after CBP detained shipments of Bitmain’s S21 and T21 application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Some companies reported paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in storage fees while awaiting equipment release.
The delays are reportedly tied to concerns over Bitmain’s ties to chip designer Sophgo, which is under investigation by US authorities for alleged connections to Huawei.
Huawei, a focal point of US sanctions since 2019, has heightened scrutiny of Chinese tech companies. The investigation has left miners scrambling to secure critical equipment, exposing the risks of dependency on Chinese manufacturers.
Bitmain’s decision to produce ASICs domestically could alleviate these challenges, ensuring a more stable supply chain while avoiding potential tariffs expected under the incoming Trump administration. By shifting production to the US, Bitmain aims to maintain its dominance in the market while addressing the growing concerns of North American customers.
Strategic shift
The US has become a significant hub for Bitcoin mining, contributing a large share of the global hashrate. However, the industry’s reliance on Chinese-manufactured equipment has made it vulnerable to geopolitical and regulatory disruptions. Bitmain’s expansion into the US represents a proactive effort to reduce these risks and strengthen its competitive position in the region.
The rollout of the Antminer S21 Pro from the new US facility is expected to provide miners with a much-needed boost in efficiency and reduce operational uncertainty. Analysts note that Bitmain’s move also signals a broader industry trend of diversifying production locations to adapt to shifting trade and regulatory landscapes.
As the Trump administration prepares to take office, the implications for US-China trade policies and their impact on the crypto sector remain uncertain. For Bitmain and the broader mining community, the establishment of US-based production marks a critical step in navigating the challenges of a rapidly evolving market.",https://cryptoslate.com/bitmain-launches-us-production-line-to-outmaneuver-geopolitical-trade-tensions/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-09 21:10:14.811700,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/d8b/d8b6f9f026148e361ffa9f3ef4f414511e265592.jpg,Successfully Scraped

news/analytics/30202732/,Binance CEO Richard Teng Makes a Statement for the End of 2024: He Talked About The Fate Of Cryptocurrencies After Trump,"Binance CEO Richard Teng shared his views on the evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, especially under the potential influence of the Trump administration and its “crypto-friendly” stance, in a recent interview.
Teng touched on a wide range of topics, including Binance's compliance efforts, global market strategies, and the state of crypto adoption in regions like the Middle East.
The famous CEO noted that it was important for Donald Trump to select crypto-friendly figures for key roles such as SEC Chairman and crypto chief. Teng described 2024 as a turning point, pointing to milestones such as the price increase of Bitcoin, approval of ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum, and the increasing involvement of institutions such as BlackRock.
On the potential impact of Trump’s regulatory stance, Teng commented: “We now have a crypto-friendly president in America… This represents the most innovative technology for the future, and countries that adopt it will do very well.” However, he added that Binance continues to focus on compliance and global operations rather than engaging in political lobbying to influence regulatory decisions in the US.
Addressing Binance’s ongoing scrutiny by U.S. regulators, including the Department of Justice and the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Teng said the company is committed to compliance. “Compliance is the way to go,” Teng said, noting that Binance invested $230 million in compliance programs last year, a 30% increase from previous years.
Binance is currently licensed in over 20 countries, including India, Argentina, and several European countries. “We continue to work closely with U.S. watchdogs to further enhance our programs,” Teng said, describing compliance as a competitive advantage.
Speaking at Abu Dhabi Financial Week, Teng said the Middle East is growing in importance for Binance, citing high crypto adoption rates in the UAE, which are around 40%. He praised the region’s regulatory foresight, particularly Abu Dhabi’s early adoption of a crypto framework in 2018, positioning it as a global hub for blockchain and digital assets.
When asked about the U.S. market and the potential introduction of a stablecoin framework, Teng described the discussion as “premature.” Instead, he focused on Binance’s global growth, citing net inflows exceeding $20 billion this year and increasing institutional adoption. Teng also mentioned Binance’s $1 billion SAFU fund for user protection and ongoing efforts to combat scams and fraud.
As Binance navigates the evolving crypto landscape, Teng expressed optimism about the future of the industry, saying, “The future is extremely bright, especially as more countries, institutions, and sovereign wealth funds embrace digital assets.”

news/analytics/30202603/,Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Surge Slows as Indicators Point to More Corrections Ahead,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) price has risen by 59.71% in the last 30 days, although its market cap has decreased from the $18 billion mark. Despite this decline, SHIB remains the second-largest meme coin in the market, only behind Dogecoin.
SHIB’s 7-day MVRV is currently at -3.79%, indicating that holders have experienced an average loss of about 4% over the past week. This suggests that the asset may be undervalued or oversold, with the potential for further short-term corrections before any price rebound.
SHIB 7D MVRV Shows More Corrections Could Happen Soon
Shiba Inu 7-day MVRV is currently at -3.79%, down from 5% a day ago.
This indicates that SHIB holders have, on average, suffered a loss of about 4% over the past week, suggesting that the asset may be undervalued or oversold.
SHIB 7D MVRV. Source: Santiment
MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) measures the difference between an asset’s market cap and its realized cap. A negative MVRV indicates that the asset is potentially oversold. While SHIB’s 7D MVRV is negative, historical data shows that it has often rebounded after reaching similar levels.
However, it has also continued to decline to -4% or even -9% before price surges occurred. This means that Shiba Inu price may face further short-term declines before a potential price recovery.
Shiba Inu Whales Are Not Accumulating
The number of addresses holding at least 1 billion SHIB has decreased recently, from 10,860 on December 5 to 10,845 now.
This decline follows a pattern seen over the past month, as the number of such addresses has been steadily falling since November 8, when it was at 11,013.
Addresses Holding At Least 1 Billion SHIB. Source: Santiment
Tracking these whale addresses is important because they can significantly influence the price of SHIB. A decline in whale activity could suggest reduced buying pressure or potential distribution of holdings, which may put downward pressure on the price.
Given the recent decline in large SHIB holders, it could indicate that selling pressure is increasing, which may lead to further price declines if these whales continue to reduce their positions.
SHIB Price Prediction: Will SHIB Rebound Soon?
The SHIB price EMA lines are still showing a bullish trend, with short-term lines positioned above long-term ones.
However, the price is currently below the short-term lines, signaling a potential shift in the trend.
SHIB Price Analysis. Source: TradingView
If the downtrend gains momentum, SHIB price could test its first support levels at $0.000028 and $0.000026. If these fail to hold, the price might drop further to $0.000023.
On the other hand, if whale activity picks up and MVRV triggers a rebound, SHIB price could rise and test resistance at $0.000033, potentially moving up to $0.000035 and $0.000040 if the resistance is broken.",https://beincrypto.com/shiba-inu-shib-price-more-corrections-ahead/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-09 20:10:16.425316,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/cdd/cdd10d3bc2ddba6c619c082f5427b9bd8e605e6d.jpg,Successfully Scraped
news/bitcoin/30202730/,MicroStrategy bitcoin purchases aren’t stopping premium decline,"MicroStrategy acquired another $2 billion worth of bitcoin (BTC) last week, but it hasn’t helped investors regain last month’s confidence. The premium shareholders place on its stock is at a two-month low, and its share price is 30% off its all-time high from November 21.
MicroStrategy has a small software business, yet most investors calculate its value as a multiple of its BTC holdings. To that end, on November 20, the company owned $31 billion of BTC yet traded at a $106 billion market capitalization — a generous, 3.4X premium.
At publication time, that multiple has
declined by one-third
to 2.2X.
On November 20, MicroStrategy owned $31B of BTC and traded at a $106B market capitalization.
Over the past three weeks, bullish traders have claimed price targets for MicroStrategy upwards of 10 or even 100 times higher than current prices. Some believe the company can somehow eclipse the value of BTC itself.

news/market/30202715/,"Binance deposit address sets up Magic Eden (ME) wallet, is a listing coming?","Magic Eden is just a day away from its token generation event for the native ME asset. Speculations of a Binance listing appeared even before the event’s official launch.
Magic Eden is preparing for its token generation event, expected on December 10. The ME asset is one of the high-profile airdrops at the end of the year. Magic Eden took one of the top positions for
mindshare
on social media. The Magic Eden airdrop follows the announcement of PENGU, the token of the Pudgy Penguins collection. The ME launch also follows the
Hyperliquid
airdrop, one of the more valuable token distributions in 2024.
Speculations of the token’s future emerged, especially about its potential listings. ME claims will open at 2 PM GMT on Tuesday, but the asset may not have an immediate mechanism for price discovery.
Tomorrow is the big day, and no, we’re not talking about your wife’s boyfriend’s birthday.$ME claim starts at 2PM GMT on 12/10 📌

— Magic Eden 🪄 (@MagicEden) December 9, 2024
ME will launch with high expectations and a conservative launch price of around $3. Others predict an initial price of $5, or $10 in an extreme hype scenario. The ME ticker is already trading in
pre-market
speculation, with prices as high as $4.65, suggesting a higher range for the first hours of trading. Pre-launch markets were also available on Aevo, starting out at $2.20 before rallying to levels above $4.50.
Magic Eden bets on renewed interest for NFT and on long-term users to revive its activity. The launch of the ME token also comes as OpenSea aims to reopen its new NFT trading platform by the end of the year.
Magic Eden has advised against following any alternative token generation links or airdrop suggestions, while only using its official information channels for the airdrop and the start of trading. ME tokens will be immediately available for swaps through the Phantom wallet, though with some restrictions based on available trading pairs.
User expectations are for ME airdrops to be worth a few hundred dollars. However, some long-term NFT holders and traders were surprised to have a relatively small allocation. The expectations are that not all activities will boost the ME airdrop, but there may be a higher allocation for the holders of the Magic Eden Diamond Collection.
Is Binance preparing for a ME listing?
The actual ME token has not yet been created, and Magic Eden has not announced an official smart contract. Despite this, on-chain researchers are pointing to speculations of Binance preparing for deposits. Binance itself has not announced its intentions to list ME. Only OKX mentioned its plans to immediately list the asset, while KuCoin even allows pre-market price discovery.
A
wallet
tagged as ‘Binance Deposit’ by Arkham Intelligence was tracked for signs of onboarding ME. This wallet was the creator and owner of another
token account
, tagged as ‘Magic Eden’.
This token account leads to a smart contract with an ME and a ‘Magic Eden’ tag, but not yet a verified status. The ME
contract
is linked to other small-scale wallets as owners, and the distribution in percentage terms is not similar to the previously announced ME tokenomics.
The only available ME token at the moment was
minted
in a single transaction 19 days ago in late November, with most of the tokens held back ahead of the expected distribution.
For now, the best approach is to keep track of the verified token addresses, while avoiding speculative assets. While potentially connected to Binance, the current ME token transactions are not yet reliable.
The newly launched ME asset is also showing low-grade trading activity, raising more doubts about whether it is the real token. When the official contract is announced, Magic Eden will also announce the first listings. However, data from Birdeye shows
addresses
are trying to send SOL liquidity even before the formation of a trading pair.
The other disparity is that ME is intended to become a multi-chain token, with launches on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon.
The December 10 airdrop will distribute 12.5% of the total supply. Over time, the community will receive 50.2% of the total token supply. The goal of ME is to serve as a governance token, making decisions on the NFT market.

The exchange had given its users until January 13, 2025 to withdraw their funds from the exchange. However, there were some unexpected developments after this announcement. Celo postponed the migration decision to a later date in 2025.
Along with the postponement decision, Coinbase also published a new announcement, stating that the delisting decision has also been postponed and that Coinbase will continue to evaluate Celo's future on the platform.
It is not known whether Celo postponed its migration as a result of the developments with Coinbase.
According to Coinbase's official statement, CELO will not be delisted for now and the last withdrawal announcement on January 13, 2025 will also be considered invalid. Users will continue to buy, sell, deposit and withdraw CELO via Coinbase for now.
The decision to delist Celo was met with backlash from the community, however, Coinbase could still delist the token once the migration is complete.

news/other/30202714/,"Google’s quantum chip ‘Willow’ shatters records, compressing centuries of computing into minutes","Google has
unveiled
its latest quantum chip, Willow, demonstrating unprecedented performance by solving tasks in minutes that would take classical supercomputers 10 septillion years.
The chip, announced by Hartmut Neven, Founder and Lead of Google Quantum AI, achieved a breakthrough in quantum error correction, a process that ensures accurate computations essential for reliable quantum computing.
Willow completed a random circuit sampling benchmark computation in under 5 minutes, a task that would require an estimated 10 septillion years on Frontier, the world’s fastest supercomputer.
The chip showed exponential error reduction as the number of qubits increased.
“Errors are one of the greatest challenges in quantum computing. Willow demonstrates that the more qubits we use, the more we reduce errors—a tipping point for scalable quantum computing,” Neven said.
The chip, fabricated at Google’s Santa Barbara facility, uses superconducting qubits, a technology also employed by IBM and Amazon.
“Our money is on superconducting qubits,” Neven said, while acknowledging the company continues to explore other approaches like neutral atom qubits.
While the advancement is notable, Google recognizes remaining challenges in achieving practical applications.
“If you cannot win at least on a problem, you won’t win on a useful problem either,” Neven explained, though he indicated commercially relevant use cases are “now getting within reach.”
While practical applications have not yet been achieved, potential future uses for quantum computing span across medicine, energy, and artificial intelligence, including areas such as drug discovery, battery design, and fusion energy research.

news/other/30202365/,"Wabisabi Deanonymization Vulnerability ""Disclosed""","GingerWallet, the fork of WasabiWallet maintained by former zkSNACKs employees after the shut down of the Wasabi coinjoin coordinator, has received a vulnerability report from developer drkgry. This vulnerability would allow the total deanonymization of users inputs and outputs in a coinjoin round, giving a malicious coordinator the ability to completely undo any privacy gains from coinjoining by performing an active attack.
Wasabi 2.0 was a complete re-design of how Wasabi coordinated coinjoins, moving from the Zerolink framework utilizing fixed denomination mix amounts, to the Wabisabi protocol allowing dynamic multi-denomination amounts. This process involved switching from homogenous blinded tokens to register outputs to claim your coins back, to a dynamic credentials system called Keyed Verification Anonymous Credentials (KVACs). This would allow users to register blinded amounts that prevented theft of other users’ coins without revealing to the server plain-text amounts that could be correlated and prevent linking ownership of separate inputs.
When users begin participating in a round, they poll the coordinator server for information regarding the round. This returns a value in the RoundCreated parameters, called maxAmountCredentialValue. This is the highest value credential the server will issue. Each credential issuance is identifiable based on the value set here.
To save bandwidth, multiple proposed methods for clients to cross-verify this information were never implemented. This allows a malicious coordinator to give each user when they begin registering their inputs a unique maxAmountCredentialValue. In subsequent messages to the coordinator, including output registration, the coordinator could identify which user it was communicating with based on this value.
By “tagging” each user with a unique identifier in this way, a malicious coordinator can see which outputs are owned by which users, negating all privacy benefits they could have gained from coinjoining.
To my knowledge drkgry discovered this independently and disclosed it in good faith, but the members of the team who were present at zkSNACKs during the design phase of Wabisabi were absolutely aware of this issue.
“The second purpose of the round hash is to protect the clients from tagging attacks by the server, the credential issuer parameters must be identical for all credentials and other round metadata should be the same for all clients (e.g. to ensure that the server isn't trying to influence clients to create some detectable bias in registrations).”
It was brought up in 2021 by Yuval Kogman, also known as nothingmuch, in 2021. Yuval was the developer to design what would become the Wabisabi protocol, and one of the designers in actually specifying the full protocol with ‪István András Seres‬.
One final note is the tagging vulnerability is not actually addressed without this suggestion from Yuval as well as full ownership proofs bound to actual UTXOs as proposed in his original pull request discussing tagging attacks. All of the data being sent to clients isn’t bound to a specific round ID, so a malicious coordinator is still capable of pulling a similar attack by giving users unique round IDs and simply copying the necessary data and re-assigning each unique round ID per-user before sending any messages.
This is not the only outstanding vulnerability present in the current implementation of Wasabi 2.0 created by the rest of the team cutting corners during the implementation phase.",https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/wabisabi-deanonymization-vulnerability-disclosed?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-09 20:10:18.413101,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/5d9/5d9ade35a70e75a3a982c3950ec74c1cfa6ac1e7.jpg,Successfully Scraped

Sacks takes the helm
Donald Trump’s recent moves in the crypto space show no signs of slowing down. Just a day after appointing crypto advocate Paul Atkins on Dec. 4 to lead the SEC in 2025, Trump introduced a new face on Dec. 5 to shape his administration’s AI and crypto strategies: David Sacks.

The former PayPal executive, venture capitalist, and co-host of the All-In Podcast has been named the White House’s first “A.I. & Crypto Czar.”
The announcement comes amid a series of pro-crypto developments. In November, Trump unveiled a new advisory board, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Co-led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, this board is tasked with streamlining government operations.
The name, a clear nod to the meme-inspired crypto Dogecoin (DOGE), has already sparked speculation about Trump’s administration embracing digital currencies.
As a result, Bitcoin (BTC) surged past $100,000 shortly after the Atkins announcement on Dec. 5, reaching an all-time high of $103,900 before settling around $99,000 as of Dec. 9.
In a Truth Social post announcing Sacks’ appointment, Trump praised him as a person of “business experience, intelligence, and pragmatism.” Sacks is now tasked with tackling critical challenges in both AI and crypto.

These tasks include establishing a legal framework to enable crypto businesses to flourish and addressing what Trump has described as “Big Tech bias and censorship.”
So, who is David Sacks, and what does this appointment really mean for the future of crypto and AI in America? Let’s take a closer look at the man behind the title, his responsibilities, and the broader reactions from the crypto world
Who is David Sacks?
David Sacks is far more than a Silicon Valley entrepreneur. His journey through tech, venture capital, and thought leadership has made him one of the most prominent voices in innovation today.
Born in South Africa and educated at Stanford University and the University of Chicago Law School, Sacks first gained recognition as the Chief Operating Officer of PayPal during its formative years.
This experience not only defined his career but also positioned him within the influential “PayPal Mafia,” a group of early PayPal executives who went on to build groundbreaking companies. Fellow members include Elon Musk, a vocal proponent of crypto, and Peter Thiel, one of Bitcoin’s earliest supporters.
After PayPal’s sale to eBay in 2002, Sacks turned his focus to entrepreneurship. In 2008, he founded Yammer, an enterprise-focused social network similar to “Facebook for businesses.”
Four years later, Microsoft acquired Yammer for $1.2 billion, cementing Sacks’ reputation as someone who could build and scale tech ventures to global success.
He didn’t even stop there — he founded Craft Ventures, a San Francisco-based venture capital firm known for backing disruptive startups.
Moreover, Sacks’ connection to the crypto world isn’t recent. As early as 2017, he was advocating for the huge potential of Bitcoin, calling it the cornerstone of a “decentralized web” or the “internet of money.”
Sacks’ perspective aligns with the ethos of the crypto community and sheds light on why Trump, who has pivoted to a pro-crypto stance in recent years, sees Sacks as a natural fit for guiding policy in this domain.
Another unique aspect of Sacks’ profile is his role as a co-host of the All-In Podcast. The podcast, co-hosted with Chamath Palihapitiya, Jason Calacanis, and David Friedberg, covers a mix of economics, technology, and politics, often with a focus on crypto and blockchain.
Palihapitiya, for instance, has been a vocal advocate for Bitcoin, famously predicting its value to rise to millions in the coming decades. Jason Calacanis has similarly shown interest in decentralized technologies, often discussing their disruptive potential.
Beyond the podcast, Sacks has remained closely aligned with key figures in the tech world, including Musk. He even played a key role in Musk’s acquisition of Twitter (now X).
His influence extends to venture capital as well. Under Craft Ventures, Sacks has backed several startups operating in the blockchain and decentralized finance space, hinting at a strategic belief in crypto’s potential in global finance.
For a crypto industry long plagued by regulatory uncertainty, his appointment offers a glimmer of hope for clearer, more forward-looking policies.
Industry voices on Sacks’ appointment
Sacks’ new role as the White House A.I. & Crypto Czar has drawn reactions from some of the biggest names in tech and crypto, and those who know Sacks, either personally or through his work, are optimistic about what he brings to the table.
Musk, who has worked closely with Sacks on several ventures, kept his message simple: “Indeed, congratulations, David!” — giving a subtle nod to each word from Trump’s Truth Social post.
Indeed, congratulations David!
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 6, 2024
Their long-standing partnership, including Musk’s leadership in the newly established DOGE advisory board, hints at a potential synergy between private-sector innovation and government policy under Sacks’ guidance
Tyler Winklevoss, an early Bitcoin investor and co-founder of Gemini, framed Sacks’ appointment as a win for pro-business and pro-crypto policies. “David’s a multiple-time tech founder with huge successes,” Winklevoss noted.
https://twitter.com/tyler/status/1864847390760484921
He pointed out that Sacks is someone who “was super early in crypto” and understands what it takes to build meaningful policies that support business and innovation, calling the decision a bullish move for the U.S. economy.
Palihapitiya, Sacks’ co-host on the All-In Podcast, said, “David Sacks is the very best of America—a successful entrepreneur, a principled free speech absolutist, and a brilliant technologist.”
David Sacks is the very best of America – a successful entrepreneur, a principled free speech absolutist and a brilliant technologist. He will make sure the US stays at the forefront of AI and Crypto – two of the most consequential technological movements in history.
Make…
— Chamath Palihapitiya (@chamath) December 6, 2024
Chamath’s focus on free speech also aligns with one of Sacks’ key goals in this role—addressing concerns about Big Tech bias while shaping policies for crypto and AI.
For those in the industry like Jeremy Allaire, CEO of USDC’s issuer Circle, this appointment seems like a validation of crypto and AI’s role in shaping the future. Allaire noted that Trump’s decision shows a recognition that these technologies are critical for maintaining the U.S.’ edge in the global innovation race.
What I love about the @realDonaldTrump appointment of @DavidSacks is the White House implicit acknowledgment that Crypto and AI are the most strategic new tech areas for the United States and the world. Well done.
— Jeremy Allaire – jda.eth / jdallaire.sol (@jerallaire) December 6, 2024
Allaire’s optimism was echoed by Ripple’s (XRP) CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who believes Sacks will play a key role in driving “pro-innovation plans” forward, especially in providing clarity to the regulatory chaos that has frustrated crypto firms for years.
Huge congrats to @DavidSacks on this appointment – he understands tech inside and out, and importantly, will push forward President Trump’s crypto and AI pro-innovation plans.
Dream team! https://t.co/FFMSCIiscl

A pro-crypto administration: What the future holds?
For years, regulatory uncertainty has plagued the U.S. crypto industry. Under the current SEC chair, Gary Gensler, the agency’s approach has been widely criticized as overly aggressive, with enforcement actions taking precedence over clear guidelines.
With the appointment of Sacks as the White House A.I. & Crypto Czar and Atkins set to replace Gensler as SEC chair, the stage seems set for a significant policy overhaul.
Atkins has been a known advocate for lighter regulatory frameworks, and he will step into his role as the SEC chief in January 2025.
Back in 2018, Atkin argued that excessive red tape could stifle innovation in the blockchain sector. His appointment represents a major win for the crypto industry, which has struggled with ambiguous rules around whether tokens are securities or commodities.
Musk’s involvement adds another layer of momentum. Musk has been a vocal supporter of crypto, famously enabling Tesla to accept Bitcoin payments briefly and often using his social media influence to drive interest in Dogecoin.
Topping it all, Sacks’ mandate to create a clear legal framework for the crypto industry could finally address the patchwork of inconsistent rules that have left many businesses either in limbo or relocating to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions like Dubai and Singapore.
If these appointments signal anything, it’s this: the future of America’s crypto industry is no longer a question of if but how far it can go.

news/bitcoin/30201738/,Some bitcoin ETFs are doing better than others,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions,

.
It goes without saying: What’s good for bitcoin is good for bitcoin ETFs.
No surprise then that almost $10 billion net has now flowed into US-listed spot funds since Trump’s win — about 83% going to BlackRock’s IBIT.
Some ETFs are still doing better than others.
To be clear: Share prices for the ETFs, by design, closely track the price of bitcoin. But share prices don’t reflect whether the funds
themselves
are up or down on their bitcoin purchases to date.
Blue is IBIT, orange is GBTC. Notice that flows relaxed when bitcoin’s price trended sideways
Every stock market trading day, the funds must spend the cash flowing into them on an equivalent amount of BTC. And vice versa: They must offload coins when net flows are negative.
So, it’s possible to calculate an estimate for how much BTC each fund buys and sells per day, by dividing the daily US dollar flow figures by the price of bitcoin (per CF Benchmark reference rate, which all the major funds use).
Tally those BTC-denominated flows together and you get their cumulative current holdings: over 855,000 BTC ($84.2 billion), not counting Grayscale’s GBTC and BTC, and more than 1.1 million BTC ($108.3 billion) when included. That’s about 5.6% of the circulating supply.
But what we’re after is the value of each fund’s BTC stash compared to how much they paid for all those coins, what I’ve called relative value on the chart below.
It turns out that Invesco-Galaxy’s BTCO is far ahead of the rest of the pack — it has acquired around 8,740 BTC net for $418.9 million so far. As of this morning, BTCO’s bitcoin would fetch $860.6 million, putting its shareholder collective ahead by more than 100%.
As you can see on the next chart, three-quarters of BTCO’s net flows to date came in the first two weeks of live trading, when bitcoin was changing hands for under $43,000.
BTCO’s average estimated purchase price per coin: $47,930.
Compare that to BlackRock’s IBIT. It has maintained more steady flows over the past 11 months — acquiring roughly 523,935 BTC from $34.4 billion net flows.
That means the ETF has effectively dollar-cost averaged its bitcoin stash to date, giving it an average coin price of $65,600.
IBIT is about 50% ahead on its BTC purchases to date and has timed the market worse than any other fund in the cohort.
Of course, IBIT’s BTC has appreciated much more than BTCO’s in raw dollar terms, on account of the sheer size of the fund by comparison.
Still, hats off to BTCO’s contributors. Now let’s see how long they can hold.",https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-etf-performance-comparison?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-09 20:10:19.638922,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/482/482403ad6036c0f1c69222bd4a3476494e02cb06.jpg,Successfully Scraped
news/analytics/30201744/,Aptos Eyes $20 as Bullish Momentum Builds with Strong Support at $13.50,"Aptos shows strong bullish momentum, targeting $20 as it breaks resistance with consistent upward movement.
Support at $13.50 and bullish indicators signal the potential for Aptos to achieve new highs above $20 soon.
RSI and Stochastic RSI confirm upward momentum, with a $16-$19 resistance zone being the next key hurdle for Aptos.
Aptos (APT) has displayed a strong bullish trend in recent months, with price action suggesting sustained momentum. The APT/USDT trading pair on Binance shows consistent upward movements driven by key technical patterns. After overcoming critical support levels, the cryptocurrency is now targeting a significant resistance zone.
Price Action Signals Continued Strength
Initially, APT experienced a decline marked by sell signals, with prices falling below $10. However, this trend reversed as buy signals emerged, leading to consistent upward movement. Prices climbed steadily, hitting multiple take-profit (TP) levels. The first chart from analyst Santolita on the X platform illustrates a bullish trajectory supported by a rising trendline.
Source: Santolita
In November, a consolidation phase occurred within a rectangular range. This phase ended with a breakout supported by a buy signal. Consequently, prices surged higher, reaffirming the bullish momentum. The trendline beneath price action confirms sustained strength, while TP levels continue to align with the upward trajectory.
Moreover, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) highlights strong momentum. Periods of rising RSI align with bullish trends, while minor corrections are reflected in brief RSI declines. The projection of $20 as a target is reinforced by both the RSI and the ongoing bullish structure.
Key Levels and Momentum Indicators
The second chart analysed by crypto analyst CryptoLax further validates Aptos’ bullish outlook. The $13.50 level has emerged as confirmed support, providing a foundation for further gains. Additionally, the $16.00 to $19.00 resistance zone remains a crucial challenge for bulls. If this zone is breached, significant upside potential exists.
Source: CryptoLax
The Stochastic RSI also points to upward momentum, showing room for additional price growth. The indicator’s position suggests that Aptos remains in an overbought region but has the capacity to push higher.
Aptos continues to exhibit strong bullish momentum, supported by key levels, breakout patterns, and positive indicators. The $13.50 support has fortified its position, while the $20 target aligns with the established trendline. Besides, the upward trajectory suggests that Aptos may achieve new highs if resistance levels are surpassed. Momentum indicators and strong partnerships further bolster its growth outlook.",https://cryptonewsland.com/aptos-eyes-20-as-bullish-momentum-builds-with-strong-support-at-13-50/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-09 20:10:20.042056,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/2cc/2cc39824f274eda949a0331a8853ebeb323f36d4.jpg,Successfully Scraped
news/altcoins/30201767/,"Toncoin (TON), Solana (SOL) Next to Reach New ATHs?","As Bitcoin (BTC) and Binance Coin (BNB) became the first major cryptocurrencies to set new price ATHs in this cycle, experts are certain that more coins will follow the leaders soon. A CryptoQuant community analyst who goes by Maartunn shared his views.
Solana (SOL), Toncoin (TON) target ATHs, expert says
Solana (SOL) and Toncoin (TON), two major altcoins and key cryptocurrencies of eponymous L1 blockchains, might be the next cryptos to reach price ATHs. The Price Drawdown Heatmap, a chart that displays how far a cryptocurrency is from reaching the price record, has highlighted SOL and TON amid all altcoins.
Such estimations were shared by Maartunn, a CryptoQuant community analyst, in his recent CryptoQuant QuickTake post.
The expert stresses that Solana (SOL) is only 8% below its current ATH, while Toncoin (TON) follows closely at 15% below its peak.
The Solana (SOL) price reached its all-time high on Sept. 9, 2021, at $216. Toncoin (TON) hit the record price level on June 15, 2024, when the price spiked over $6.82.
TON euphoria was triggered by the popularity of Notcoin (NOT), Hamster Combat (HAMSTER) and a number of other dApps on TON, as well as by the decision by Tether to issue USDT on the blockchain.
Solana (SOL) outperforms competitor by DeFi metrics
Crypto expert Maartunn outlined that both Solana (SOL) and Toncoin (TON) demonstrate strong fundamentals, including active development teams and active networks.
While both cryptos have performed well in this rally, their metrics of DeFi activity follow totally different patterns. For Solana (SOL), the current total value locked (TVL) indicator over $9 billion is almost equal to the ATH set in 2021.
By contrast, Toncoin (TON) reached its peak TVL this summer. Since July, the metric dropped from $769 million to $387 million in equivalent.",https://u.today/toncoin-ton-solana-sol-next-to-reach-new-aths?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-09 20:10:20.445223,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/f07/f07606822b0569c1fe7ebdba04203d3759781c25.jpg,Successfully Scraped
news/analytics/30201602/,Pundit Says XRP Will Retire a Lot of People: Here’s How,"Amid the resilience demonstrated by XRP, a market pundit insists the altcoin will be the reason multiple investors finally retire.
The crypto market
is currently facing
investor uncertainty after a previous upsurge triggered by the latest Bitcoin (BTC)
push toward $100,000
. Despite the pullback that ensued, XRP has shown resilience against further bearish pressure. As a result, the altcoin has held above $2.4 for days.
This comes after a massive uptrend that allowed it to breach $2 on Dec. 1. Since recently overcoming the $2 mark for the first time in seven years, XRP has not dropped below the price mark despite the occasional pullbacks. This has bolstered confidence in its potential.
Optimism Around XRP’s Potential
For instance, Bark, a crypto market pundit and founder of Bark Media, boldly asserted that
XRP
is going to
give multiple investors the necessary returns to allow them to retire. Notably, the goal for a lot of crypto investors is to make enough profit to retire from work.
$XRP is going to retire A LOT of people
— Bark (@barkmeta) December 2, 2024
However, the requirements for retirement vary depending on the investor’s geography and
his
appetite. While some individuals could retire on $700,000 if they live in a low-income country with less cost of living, others who live in places like the U.S. might require more
to comfortably retire
.
Notably, a
report
from CNBC earlier in the year confirmed that a resident of Hawaii would need $2 million to retire for 25 years, marking the highest retirement threshold for any state in the U.S. However, the average 30-year retirement threshold in the U.S. is
a little
above $1 million.
Given these realities, certain proponents have wondered if just holding XRP could retire an investor. Considering a retirement threshold of $2 million, above the average, an investor could hit this level based on his capital and the price targets that
XRP
is able to
claim
.
At What Price Can XRP Retire Investors?
This assessment would consider an initial investment of $10,000, allowing an entry point for the average retail investor. If an investor buys $10,000 worth of XRP at the current price of $2.44, he would procure 4,098 XRP tokens.
Notably, for these tokens to hit the retirement threshold of $2 million, XRP must reach an ambitious price of $488 per token. This would mark a massive appreciation rate of 19,900% for the altcoin, pushing its market cap to an audacious $27.8 trillion.
The chances of this materializing within the next few years are rather slim. As a result, investors looking to retire with XRP might need to commit more than $10,000 at current prices. For instance, a $400,000 investment in XRP would yield the $2 million retirement threshold at
$12, a more realistic target
.
However, investors who
already
procured XRP before its recent breakout have better
chances
of retiring at lower price targets.
Interestingly, an investor who procured $100,000 worth of XRP when it consolidated at $0.5 from Nov. 1 to 4, would have 200,000 tokens. These 200,000 XRP would be worth $2 million at
a $10 price
.
Nonetheless, while these estimates can be rather enticing, it is important to note that they rely on speculative assessments. There is no guarantee that XRP would reach $10, $12
or
any target necessary to make an investor retire.",https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/09/pundit-says-xrp-will-retire-a-lot-of-people-heres-how/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-09 19:10:20.939329,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/b69/b697e6700f7edb1f4f8ca31f95545a187e339f1b.png,Successfully Scraped

news/analytics/30202510/,AI predicts MultiversX (EGLD) price for year-end,"MultiversX (EGLD), formerly known as Elrond, is rapidly solidifying its position as one of the most technologically advanced blockchain platforms.
Currently trading at $49.70, EGLD has gained 10.8% over the past week and an impressive 71% over the last month, reflecting growing investor confidence.
Praised by Cyber Capital’s Justin Bons as the “technological Holy Grail of crypto,” MultiversX’s implementation of sharding positions it as a leader in scalability, achieving over 100,000 transactions per second.
This sets it apart from competitors like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), which rely on second-layer solutions to address scalability challenges.
Key fundamentals driving MultiversX’s growth
MultiversX’s capped token supply of 31.4 million, combined with its robust DeFi use cases and forthcoming upgrades like sub-second block times, continues to enhance its market appeal.
The platform offers users opportunities to earn passive income, generate yield, and benefit from features such as secure proof-of-stake, cross-chain interoperability, on-chain two-factor authentication, and opt-in gasless transactions, reinforcing its position as one of the most advanced blockchain platforms.
Strengthening its growth trajectory, MultiversX has forged a collaboration with Alibaba Cloud, paving the way for its strategic push into Asian markets.
This partnership aims to onboard Alibaba’s extensive customer base into the MultiversX ecosystem, a move with the potential to significantly expand its user adoption.
The impact of this collaboration is already evident, with EGLD gaining momentum on South Korea’s largest crypto exchange, Upbit, signaling notable progress in its market expansion efforts.
Further strengthening its momentum, EGLD’s inclusion in Coinbase’s COIN50 Index, which highlights promising cryptocurrencies, reflects growing institutional confidence.
This recognition was amplified on November 13, when Coinbase announced the listing and expansion of six new cryptocurrencies for New York citizens, with MultiversX being a notable addition.
This move aligns with the COIN50 Index rebalancing, positioning MultiversX as a key player in the evolving crypto market and setting the stage for further growth as the bull market unfolds.
AI predicts EGLD year-end price
To gauge EGLD’s future potential, Finbold leveraged market data and consulted ChatGPT-4o to analyze its prospects.
According to the artificial intelligence (AI) model, EGLD is projected to close 2024 trading between $60 and $70, driven by a combination of technological advancements, strategic partnerships, and bullish market sentiment.
However, in a bearish scenario influenced by market corrections or macroeconomic pressures, EGLD could retrace to the $40 to $45 range.
As MultiversX continues to expand its footprint through innovation and collaboration, its growing reputation as a leader in scalability and security sets the stage for sustained long-term growth.

news/legal/30202450/,What Paul Atkins as SEC Chair and David Sacks as Crypto Czar mean for the future of crypto,"With President-elect Donald Trump naming Paul Atkins as SEC Chair and venture capitalist David Sacks as the first-ever White House Crypto Czar, the crypto industry is poised for a seismic shift.
These appointments mark a significant departure from the SEC’s enforcement-heavy stance under Gary Gensler and signal the Trump administration’s intent to create a more industry-friendly regulatory environment.
Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, is known for his pro-innovation stance and preference for self-regulation over heavy-handed enforcement.
His appointment has been met with optimism in the crypto sector, which frequently clashed with Gensler’s SEC.
Under Atkins’ leadership, a lighter regulatory touch is expected, with the potential shift of digital asset oversight to the CFTC, an agency seen as more crypto-friendly.
Meanwhile, David Sacks, a co-founder of Craft Ventures and former PayPal executive, brings a business-oriented approach to the newly created role of Crypto Czar.
Tasked with centralizing crypto policy and fostering collaboration across federal agencies, Sacks’ appointment could pave the way for the US to emerge as a global leader in crypto governance.
ETF approvals and enforcement actions
Under Atkins’ leadership, the SEC’s stance on ETF approvals is expected to become more favorable.
Michele Neitz, professor and founding director of the Center for Law, Tech, and Social Good at the University of San Francisco, believes approvals for ETFs like Solana’s will likely be expedited.
“An Atkins-led SEC will probably move more quickly on ETF approvals, focusing on investor protection and disclosure rather than the merit-neutral language we saw under Gensler,” Neitz said.
Additionally, Atkins is expected to shift the SEC’s approach to enforcement. Neitz predicts the agency may drop its appeal in the Ripple case and reconsider other high-profile enforcement actions, such as those against Coinbase.
The Crypto Czar
Charles Belle, a professor at the University of San Francisco, notes that the Crypto Czar role could position the US as a leader in global crypto governance.
“The Czar’s flexibility and direct contact with the Oval Office could drive harmonization of regulations across federal agencies and set global standards,” Belle said.
However, he cautions that the role’s lack of institutional resources could create conflicts with other government departments and lead to inconsistent policy implementation.
Balancing innovation with investor protection
Despite the optimism surrounding these appointments, Neitz underscores the importance of maintaining investor protections.
“While a new SEC chair will likely take a softer stance on crypto companies, it’s crucial to ensure that public protection remains a priority. Otherwise, we risk widespread consumer fraud and a backlash against lighter regulation,” she said.
The Financial Innovation and Technology Act, pending before Congress, could provide much-needed clarity by establishing federal definitions for digital assets.
According to Belle, this legislation could create a unified regulatory framework that promotes innovation while safeguarding consumers.
A new era for crypto?
The appointments of Atkins and Sacks signal a potential realignment of US crypto policy, shifting from punitive enforcement to collaborative innovation.
As the Trump administration takes shape, the crypto industry awaits a clearer regulatory framework that could finally unlock its full potential.
Belle emphasized that federal changes, including the introduction of a new Crypto Czar and new SEC leadership, should clarify regulations and provide consistency, enabling startups to thrive.
However, he cautioned that while federal baselines are necessary, lawmakers must avoid stifling state-led innovation.
State-led efforts have been vital for developing pro-crypto policies in places like Wyoming and consumer protection frameworks in California.",https://cryptobriefing.com/crypto-regulation-shift-sec-chairman/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-09 20:10:23.385788,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/804/804b0b6f683c0847cb89d5f22b551721dc0fc266.jpg,Successfully Scraped
news/legal/30202471/,Eric Trump: The U.S. can become a crypto superpower with ‘sensible’ regulation,"Eric Trump revealed to CNBC’s Dan Murphy in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on December 9 that a set of “sensible” regulatory guidelines can help make the U.S. a cryptocurrency superpower.  He acknowledged the people in the crypto industry are fine with regulation, but they just want guidelines.
The son of president-elect Donald Trump also believes that his father intends to make America the crypto capital of the world on his return to the White House. Eric argued that the modern banking system is antiquated. He hopes that it’s just a matter of time before crypto not only catches up but leaps ahead.
Eric Trump sees America as the crypto capital of the world
The president-elect’s son was asked whether his father was considering regulatory or deregulatory measures in the crypto space and what the policies could look like in practice. He replied that the crypto space seems transparent.
Eric Trump added that the people in the crypto industry are frustrated that no one has ever put together a sensible plan for regulating an industry. He argued that the people in the crypto space are fine with regulation, but they just want guidelines, and they’ve said that.
Eric Trump also admitted they would have a clear road map and hoped the rest of the world would follow it.
Furthermore, Eric hopes that his father’s administration can lead by example as Americans look forward to becoming the crypto superpower of the world.
“I think America will be the crypto capital of the world. I fully support it. My father fully supports it. Our family, you know,  is fully embracing it. We believe in DeFi…We believe that’s the way of the future. And again, America, you know, better lead the way; otherwise, we’re going to leave a lot behind.”
– Eric Trump
Eric Trump wants to see a productive and efficient society
Eric described Elon Musk as the “modern-day Albert Einstein”. That’s because he believes Musk will play a big role in setting the White House’s policy agenda moving forward.
What’s more, Donald Trump named Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy as
co-leaders of an efficiency drive
that is poised to make substantial cuts to government spending, pare back regulation, and restructure agencies.
Eric Trump also revealed that Americans want to see efficiency, a productive society, and real innovation again. He added that they want to see the government step aside from great business and let businesses thrive, capitalism work, and the greatest democracy in the world do what it does.
However, the businessman admitted that America hasn’t been that way in the last four years but will return to its old glory. He hopes the billionaire technology leader will play a major role in ensuring that happens.
Donald Trump also recently announced plans to
nominate Paul Atkins
as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission to replace Gary Gensler. Trump’s move to replace Gensler could tackle the agency’s regulation-by-enforcement approach to the crypto industry.
Eric Trump’s comments came shortly after Bitcoin’s price recently surged above $100,000 for the first time. Data from
CoinMarketCap
shows that the digital asset has experienced a 124% appreciation year-to-date and has dipped back to around $98,000 as of publication.
Bitcoin’s new milestone parallels the new U.S. administration’s plan to cement the crypto industry’s place in financial markets.

news/bitcoin/30202403/,Wrapped Bitcoin hides bitcoins for WBTC on Tron,"On August 9, BitGo announced that it was transitioning Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) to a new “strategic partnership between BitGo, Justin Sun, and the Tron Ecosystem.”
The announcement continued that this partner would would “continue to provide real-time proof-of-reserves.”
Despite specifically referencing the Tron ecosystem and promising that real-time proof-of-reserves would also continue, WBTC on TRON, as well as WETH on TRON, have been removed from the WBTC dashboard, meaning the proof-of-reserves for this token is no longer available.
The dashboard no longer includes WBTC on Tron but still features the versions on Ethereum, Base, Kava, and Osmosis.
An on-chain review of WBTC on Tron doesn’t show any substantial changes in the supply recently. However, it’s not currently possible to verify the
BTC that is meant to collateralize these tokens
.

These changes to WBTC come quick on the heels of Sun-advised HTX redeeming thousands of WBTC it hadn’t previously disclosed.
It’s not clear why WBTC made this change, especially as it continues to advertise on its homepage that it’s “Completely transparent. 100% verifiable.”
This change to not disclosing its backing brings WBTC on Tron in line with Sun-owned Poloniex’s BTC on Tron product. This product is approximately
1,000 times larger than WBTC on Tron

news/bitcoin/30202363/,Bitcoin (BTC) Faces Weak Buying Pressure as Bulls Remain on the Sidelines,"Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a notable drop in buying pressure over the last few days as the cryptocurrency’s price continues to swing between $98,000 and $10,000. This drop in bullish momentum suggests that BTC might not be ready for its next leg up.
Instead, it indicates that the price might continue to trade sideways unless something changes.
Bitcoin Accumulation Lowers
One indicator showing a decline in Bitcoin buying pressure is the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR). The SSR measures the ratio of a cryptocurrency’s market capitalization to the aggregated market capitalization of all stablecoins in circulation.
Low SSR indicates higher buying power from stablecoins. It suggests that there is a large amount of stablecoin liquidity available, which could drive upward price momentum if converted into cryptocurrency.High SSR, on the other hand, reflects lower stablecoin liquidity relative to the cryptocurrency’s market cap, potentially indicating weaker BTC buying power or limited demand.
According to CryptoQuant, the Bitcoin SSR has spiked to 18.29. The conditions stated above indicate that buying power is no longer strong. As such, Bitcoin’s price might continue to trade below its all-time high of $103,900.

Another metric suggesting the same is the Bulls and Bears indicator. For context, bulls are addresses that bought at least 1% of the total trading volume within a specific period. Bears, on the flip side, are those who sold a similar amount.
When there are more bulls than bears, the BTC price is likely to increase. However, if bears have the upper hand, the opposite occurs. According to IntoTheBlock data, the number of bulls and bears over the last seven days has remained the same.
This indicates that Bitcoin bulls have refrained from buying more coins to raise the price. If this trend continues, then the BTC price might continue consolidating.

BTC Price Prediction: Further Decline Looms
On the daily chart, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has dropped to the negative region. The MACD measures the momentum around a cryptocurrency.
When the MACD is positive, momentum is bullish. However, in this case, the momentum is bearish, suggesting that BTC’s price might not experience a significant uptrend in the short term. The indicator’s position also signifies a drop in Bitcoin buying pressure.

If this remains the same, Bitcoin’s price is likely to drop to $90,623.

news/blockchain/30202120/,"Drive-and-Earn Platform Dimo Swaps Ethereum Networks, From Polygon to Base","Dimo
, a platform for developers to build apps and enable car drivers to monetize their data, is migrating between Ethereum scaling networks, the developers exclusively told
Decrypt
—from Polygon to Coinbase’s Base. Co-founder Rob Solomon believes the move opens doors for valuable partnerships ahead.
The project is a “global API layer for cars” that is aiming to make every car on earth smart and programmable. This could manifest, the company says, in a future full of AI car mechanics and smart parking garages, as well as users making money when their data is sold.
Up until this point, Dimo has been building on
Ethereum
sidechain network
Polygon
. but has decided to make the switch to the Coinbase-incubated
Base layer-2 chain
. Solomon says this is largely motivated by the plethora of collaborations that could come as a result.
“Base is popular with builders [so] we could do deeper partnerships,” Solomon told
Decrypt
.
Meet the new DIMO
This is more than a fresh paint job — today marks the beginning of a new chapter. This winter will be filled with product updates, partnership launches, driving competitions, and giveaways that redefine DIMO. The journey to onboard a billion cars starts now. 🚘 pic.twitter.com/f3sdTFrmvX
— DIMO (@DIMO_Network) November 19, 2024
Specifically, he points to
Cario
, a project that offers car ownership titles on-chain, as a possible collaborator. As well as
Blackbird
, a restaurant loyalty company, that Dimo could connect with their food trucks or
Daylight
, a DePIN project for energy devices like car chargers.
Dimo’s migration is not expected to take place until “late 2025,” as the team is still in the process of scoping out the technical specifics of the move. Users of the platform will likely not have to do anything on their end, Solomon said; at most, it’d be the press of a button.
“We love Polygon and they're great,” the co-founder told
Decrypt
. “Base just makes a ton of sense for Dimo because of the inroads and credibility they have with the types of big enterprises that we partner with. They build great products that are optimized for Base (e.g. on-ramps, paymasters, wallet systems), and their community and technology are world-class.”
Created by Coinbase,
Base
is an Ethereum layer-2 scaling network that is the on-chain home for the major crypto exchange’s products. Given the prominent firm behind it, Base launched with dozens of projects committing to building and supporting the ecosystem—including oracle
Chainlink
, block explorer Etherscan, and DeFi protocol
Aave
.
This, Dimo believes, is a great foundation for the crypto project to achieve its long-term goal of becoming an integral part of every car company.
“In 1990, no companies built their workflow on the internet and email. Today, if those things disappeared, companies would fall apart overnight since they've come to depend on those protocols,” Solomon explained. “Dimo will be the same.”
He envisions a future where Dimo’s blockchain-based Vehicle ID system will replace the current system for
vehicle identification numbers
(VINs)—that help track things like warranty claims, insurance coverage, and more—which is typically stored in a
read-only database
.
“The blockchain will be the new de facto ledger for registrations and ownership,” he said. “All payments will be made on-chain. All credentials (insured, licensed, registered) will tie back cryptographically to on-chain identifiers.”
This future that Solomon outlines, he believes, will all be underpinned by Dimo’s technology becoming a crucial part of the future of the car industry. And this vision, the company believes, is more easily achieved on Base.

news/analytics/30202006/,Buy signal for two strong cryptocurrencies this week,"The cryptocurrency market continues to showcase its dynamic and volatile nature, drawing the attention of traders and investors navigating shifting trends and emerging opportunities.
While the global market cap has dipped by 2.8% to $3.82 trillion, bearish momentum prevails, with Bitcoin (BTC) and major altcoins experiencing declines.
Yet, amidst this market-wide consolidation, certain altcoins are defying the downturn, supported by robust momentum and strong technical indicators.
The average weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at 61.73, reflecting a neutral outlook, while the 24-hour RSI has climbed to 62.13, signaling renewed optimism for short-term opportunities.
Against this backdrop, some altcoins are standing out, showcasing compelling buy setups despite the market’s challenges.
Finbold turned to the RSI heatmap from
CoinGlass
on December 9 to identify altcoins poised for growth, presenting attractive opportunities for traders and investors in the current market climate.
Dogecoin (DOGE)
Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently flashing strong buy signals across key technical indicators, presenting a compelling opportunity for traders and investors.
With an average 24-hour RSI of 62.13, DOGE remains in a bullish momentum zone, signaling strength without entering overbought territory. The cryptocurrency has seen a minor 24-hour price dip of 2.52%, trading at $0.44838, which reflects a healthy correction rather than a trend reversal.
This dip presents an attractive entry point for those looking to capitalize on a potential upward move. Furthermore, the one-week RSI at 83.56 shows sustained buying interest over a longer timeframe, signaling strong market confidence.
Historically, DOGE has shown sharp rebounds following similar consolidations, with its technical indicators suggesting the potential for another rally.
Reinforcing this outlook, all major exponential and simple moving averages (from 10 to 200 periods) signal a “buy,” pointing to consistent upward momentum across different timeframes.
Supporting this, oscillators remain neutral, signaling stability and a lack of bearish pressure. The Average Directional Index (ADX) further validates the strength of DOGE’s current directional trend.
With a combination of bullish RSI levels, supportive moving averages, and a favorable market structure, DOGE offers a high-probability setup for traders and investors looking to capture short- to medium-term gains.
Enjin Coin (ENJ)
Enjin Coin (ENJ) also exhibits a strong buying opportunity supported by a solid technical foundation and favorable market dynamics.
With a 24-hour RSI of 64.46, ENJ outperforms the market average RSI of 62.13, indicating sustained bullish momentum while remaining below the overbought threshold of 70.
This suggests the potential for further upward movement, making ENJ an attractive prospect in the current market environment.
The technical outlook is further reinforced by 11 out of 14 moving average indicators signaling a “buy.” Key moving averages, such as the 50 EMA, 100 EMA, and 200 EMA, are significantly below ENJ’s current price of $0.33883, providing robust support and highlighting consistent upward momentum across short-, medium-, and long-term timeframes.
This alignment of moving averages underscores the asset’s favorable trajectory and enhances its appeal for both traders and investors.
Although ENJ has experienced a 6.53% price decline over the past 24 hours, this correction presents a compelling entry point for those seeking to capitalize on its next potential rebound.
Corrections of this nature are often followed by upward movement, particularly when supported by strong technical indicators.
Meanwhile, oscillators remain neutral, signaling market stability and a lack of significant bearish pressure. Short-term momentum indicators, including the MACD also exhibit mild bearish signals, which warrant close monitoring.
However, the broader technical framework strongly favors bullish continuation, positioning ENJ as an asset with significant potential for medium- to long-term gains.
While these cryptocurrencies demonstrate strong momentum and robust technical support, it’s important to acknowledge that short-term market fluctuations could influence their trajectories.
Investors are encouraged to approach these opportunities with caution, perform comprehensive research, and ensure their investment strategies align with their risk tolerance and long-term financial objectives.

news/altcoins/30202528/,Baby Doge and Neiro Meme Coins Surge as Bitcoin DOG Token Hits All-Time High,"Some prominent dog-themed meme coins are fetching higher prices to start the week, with coins modeled on
Dogecoin
’s mascot jumping higher—alongside a
Bitcoin
-based meme coin that’s dedicated to a puppy wearing an orange hoodie.
DOG•GO•TO•THE•MOON (
aka DOG
), a so-called
Runes
token that launched alongside the protocol’s
debut in April
, set an all-time high price of $0.0096 late Sunday, according to data from CoinGecko. Meanwhile, its market cap hit $966 million, surpassing a previous peak seen in June.
Runes was developed by Casey Rodarmor, whose
Ordinals
project sparked a buzzy market for Bitcoin-based collectibles following its release last year. Together, the projects seek to bring assets resembling meme coins and NFTs to crypto’s O.G. network.
Meme coins are extremely volatile assets, even by crypto standards, trading on little more than vibes and the attention they can muster online. While Dogecoin’s $64 billion market cap looms large in the meme coin space, its success has paved the way for
countless tokens
riding on its canine coattails over the years, which basically exist on any chain that one can think of.
DOG•GO•TO•THE•MOON was launched by its pseudonymous co-creator Leonidas in April, who airdropped the token widely to holders of the
Runestone
Ordinals project. Among notable trading venues, the Bitcoin-based meme coin has since been listed on the OKX exchange and cross-chain NFT marketplace Magic Eden.
“A new all-time high is especially exciting because we did it without a spot listing on a tier-1 exchange,” Leonidas told
Decrypt
.
Though DOG’s price has increased 35% over the past week, investors have meanwhile looked toward meme coins with four-legged mascots on other chains. Among notable gainers, those included Baby Doge Coin on
BNB Chain
and Neiro on
Ethereum
.
Baby Doge Coin (BABYDOGE) was
launched in 2021
, and of course, it pays homage to Dogecoin. Though its peak price Monday was still below a peak of $0.000000006288, the meme coin’s price
jumped 33%
, placing it within striking distance of a previous all-time high.
When Dogecoin’s mascot, a Shiba Inu dog named Kabosu, passed away in May, the development was felt
far outside the cryptosphere
. Soon after, however, a 10-year-old rescue pooch named Neiro was later adopted by Kabosu’s owner, which the crypto community was quick to embrace.
Meme coins inspired by Neiro were
launched separately
on Ethereum and Solana. And while neither have been endorsed by Nerio’s owner, an Ethereum-based version of Neiro (NEIRO) reached a $1.1 billion market cap last month. On Monday, the token’s value
increased by 10%
, reaching a price of $0.002, according to CoinGecko.
Notably, DOG, Neiro, and Baby Doge Coin saw outsized trading volumes on Gate.io, a Cayman Islands-based exchange. Each coin had notched $61 million, $56 million, and $187 million in trading volume over the past day, respectively, on the platform, according CoinGecko.
While Bitcoin transactions involving Runes accounted for 81% of network activity days after the protocol for memetic assets was launched in April, an initial wave of hype has receded. Still, Bitcoin transactions involving Runes totaled 8% of Bitcoin transactions Sunday, suggesting their on-chain presence remains somewhat robust, per data from
Dune

news/analytics/30202003/,Altcoin’s bull run threatens market volatility – It’s not welcome,"Since November 1, altcoins have grown enormously in the crypto market, with gains reaching 99.31%. This has sparked speculation about the start of altcoin season—a bull rally of sorts. This comes particularly as Bitcoin’s dominance has declined over the last month, raising fears about volatility.
The crypto market is always unpredictable and volatile. An intriguing phenomenon that many investors have observed is that the value of many altcoins decreases when the price of Bitcoin (BTC) increases.
Donald Trump’s recent victory in the U.S. presidential election has resulted in major upside for the altcoin market. However, some market analysts have expressed concern that the current rally may be temporary.
Why is the Altcoin bull rally threatening volatility?
Liquidity flow is the most significant factor contributing to the current market environment. This is why the majority of altcoins are traded against the BTC pair on exchanges.
This induces traders to dispose of altcoins to acquire Bitcoin, thereby capitalizing on its expansion. As a result of their decline, the value of these altcoins decreases.
According to on-chain data, speculators who use leverage are incurring annualized expenses of 48% to 72% to sustain their positions.
In an uptrend, these costs may not appear to be prohibitive; however, if the market stabilizes or experiences a decline, they could result in forced liquidations or sell-offs.
One analyst cautions that these circumstances are similar to those that occurred in late 2021 when coins such as XRP and Solana experienced rapid corrections following lengthy rallies.
According to the analyst, traders may continue to exhibit irrationality. However, he said,
“We are at the point where teams and VCs start clipping more aggressively.”
Source: X
He observes that financing rates exceeding 100% annually indicate an increase in risk in a market that is already characterized by increased leverage and declining spot trading volumes.
According to Sergei Gorev from YouHodler, these coins are not to blame. He explained that the rise of Bitcoin above $100,000 has had even more of an effect on the market. Sergei added that because Bitcoin is linked to the S&P 500, its changes could have an effect on the whole crypto market.
He went further to say that divergences in technical charts and the rising value of the US dollar are signs that the rise might not last. In the past, round-number milestones for Bitcoin have caused times of higher volatility, which has added to the uncertainty.
Although these concerns persist, there is still considerable optimism regarding the altcoin market. Some traders contend that the present circumstances could result in a long-term bull market, while others believe that historical trends and the increasing cost of funding indicate a potential decline.
It is evident that the market is currently unpredictable, as evidenced by the ongoing divergence of opinions.
Is the alt season over?
In a December 5 “Volatility Review” report, Bybit observed that Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin since the US elections. The report observed that traders are beginning to adjust their preferences toward ETH, as evidenced by the significant shift in the ETH/BTC ratio.
The ratio increased from a minimum of 0.31 on November 19 to over 0.4 on Friday. Additionally, the decline in Bitcoin’s dominance has been attributed to ETH’s outperformance against Bitcoin, which has sparked speculation about the onset of an altcoin season.
Crypto market Dominance: Source – TradingView
Also, yesterday, an altcoin called Monero (XMR) was trading at $201.75 and experienced a 2% increase. The price, however, has gone down to $198.19.
Both Bitcoin and altcoins are experiencing market stagnation. As the days approach Trump’s inauguration, one of the two could eventually become bullish.
Why is there such an inverse relationship between Bitcoin and altcoins?
One is Bitcoin dominance. When Bitcoin climbs in price, investors go from altcoins to Bitcoin, a more reliable investment tool. Bitcoin’s market value rises, leading altcoins to fall.
The market sentiment also causes the inverse. Bitcoin typically sets crypto trends. Bitcoin spikes are usually good for the market. Investors choose Bitcoin over lesser-known altcoins in this era. This reduces altcoin capital flows.
In addition, market manipulation equally causes the inverse. The Bitcoin market is volatile. Big investors (called “whales”) may pump and dump altcoin values. When Bitcoin rises, these people may sell altcoins to buy more Bitcoin, causing market instability.
FOMO is also a major reason. When Bitcoin prices rise, the FOMO effect pushes investors to put more money into it. They worry about missing out on this growing trend, reducing cryptocurrency investment and value.
Despite popular belief, cryptocurrencies do not necessarily follow Bitcoin’s trajectory. Certain events or news about Bitcoin can raise its price without boosting altcoins, causing a price gap. This is called a
lack of correlation.

Riot Platforms Bitcoin strategy keeps the company financially ‘healthy’
Riot Platforms is seemingly looking to mimic MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin investment policy to buy more BTC alongside its mining operations. As of November 2024, the company held 11,425 Bitcoin, a 55% increase from its year-to-date holdings, per a Stock Titan
insight
.
During the same month, Riot Platforms announced it had mined 495 Bitcoin, maintaining steady month-over-month output despite a 7% rise in network difficulty. The company’s operational hash rate also grew by 13% compared to the previous month.
Riot aims to establish itself as the world’s foremost Bitcoin-driven infrastructure platform and continues to lead the industry in vertically integrated Bitcoin mining. With operations on a significant scale, the company projects a self-mining hash rate capacity of 34.9 EH/s by the close of FY2024.
As of the latest quarter, Riot maintained a strong financial standing,

$590.6 million in working capital, including $355.7 million in cash and $190.1 million in marketable equity securities.
An InvestingPro analysis reveals that Riot currently holds more cash than debt, reflecting a current ratio of 5.68. However, the data also indicates the company is rapidly consuming its cash reserves, although financial analysts project a strong revenue growth rate of 32% for the year.
Meanwhile, Riot Platforms saw its stock price drop by 5.8% to 12.05 pre-market trading, after unveiling plans for a private offering. The company’s shares had faced a rough start in 2024, facing a 19.7% decline within the first six months of 2024. However, in the second half, RIOT has gained by 22%, according to NASDAQ data.

news/altcoins/30201835/,Stablecoins Break $200B Mark as Ethena’s Yield-Bearing USDE Supply Soars 89%,"The stablecoin market has crossed an impressive $200 billion in value, with the top three fiat-pegged tokens experiencing notable growth over the past month. Ethena’s USDE has taken center stage, climbing over 89% since Nov. 9.
USDE Supply Soars, USD0 Issuance Climbs a Staggering 91%
As of Monday, Dec. 9, stablecoin data from coingecko.com and defillama.com reveals the fiat-pegged crypto market is thriving, holding steady above the $200 billion milestone—a record high for the sector. Tether (USDT), leading the pack, has 138.06 billion tokens in circulation, with 74.92 billion issued on Ethereum and 61.75 billion on Tron. Over the past month, USDT’s supply has increased by 13.2%, according to coingecko.
Circle’s USDC recently topped $40 billion, with its supply growing by 10.2% since Nov. 9, now reaching 40.7 billion tokens. Ethena’s USDE saw the most dramatic rise, surging 89.9% to a market cap of $5.49 billion. This yield-bearing stablecoin, which offers a 27% annual percentage yield (APY), has attracted substantial interest from market participants.
Not all stablecoins fared well. Sky’s DAI dipped 3.5% this month, while First Digital’s FDUSD dropped 22.5%. On the flip side, Sky’s sky dollar (USDS) rose to $1.05 billion. Tron’s USDD slipped by 1.6%, but usual usd (USD0) entered the top eight stablecoins with a 91.4% supply increase, now valued at $655 million.
Frax dollar (FRAX) holds a market cap of $645 million after a modest 0.7% uptick over the past month. Meanwhile, Paypal’s PYUSD saw its supply shrink by 5.5%, bringing its market valuation to $514 million.
This sector’s escalating growth highlights its increasing prominence in the digital economy, driven by competitive strategies among issuers. Yield-bearing tokens like Ethena’s USDE are pulling in users, while fluctuations in supply showcase a dynamic and evolving market.
As stablecoins soar beyond $200 billion, their expansion reflects an interplay of innovation and competition. With new players emerging and established issuers adapting, the space is alive with opportunity. Stablecoins are positioning themselves as a transformative force, potentially reshaping the global financial system for years to come. Yet, critics question whether this optimism is misplaced, pointing to regulatory hurdles and the fragility of trust in these digital tokens.",https://news.bitcoin.com/stablecoins-break-200b-mark-as-ethenas-yield-bearing-usde-supply-soars-89/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-09 19:10:29.051407,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/a06/a06dd41f49e3202adb4d9eb27108193eff118e12.png,Successfully Scraped

In a new post, Pippen again made such a claim, saying that Satoshi came to him in a dream and gave him Santa's list. On this list, according to the former basketball player, Bitcoin was listed opposite names like Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Amazon founder Bezos.
It seems that this was skillfully presented by the Chicago Bulls legend on the adoption of the main cryptocurrency by these two giants of American industry.

However, it is not without basis as, according to rumors that Microsoft may adopt Bitcoin, actively fueled by Michael Saylor, the founder of Microstretch promised to explain to the company's management the benefits of such a decision.
Is it all a dream?
As for Amazon, it recently became known that the company's shareholders asked the management to consider the possibility of directing the free cache on the balance sheet to buy BTC. On such an occasion, former Binance director Changpeng Zhao suggested that the e-commerce giant accept BTC as a means of payment and thus take two steps forward in this direction at once.

It is moving ahead with expectations for President-elect Trump’s policies and highlighting its crypto offerings for professional investors.
One of the highest points of 2024 for the crypto industry was the launch of Bitcoin-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These ETFs have drawn nearly $10 billion since Donald Trump’s election win and now cumulatively hold total net assets of $112.74 billion. This all signals bullish sentiments for the market after the appointment of a crypto-friendly SEC head.
Goldman Sachs unveils exclusive crypto services
In a recent note, Goldman Sachs offered its crypto capabilities across multiple jurisdictions with professional investors in mind. These services are only available to investors in approved countries, including the US, UK, Switzerland, Australia, and several EU nations.
The investment bank’s crypto trading desk is open for business with a variety of offerings, including BTC and ETH CME futures clearing, along with OTC non-deliverable forwards (NDF) and options (NDO). It seems like big players will have access to high liquidity while trading.
It added that Goldman Sachs has a suite of Bitcoin and Ether ETPs. This includes US BTC ETFs like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), and more.

Portnoy, who owned a small amount of BTC and other cryptos several years ago and then sold it all, now seems to regret his decision, seeing that MicroStrategy spearheaded by Saylor keeps buying Bitcoin non-stop.

Portnoy and his Bitcoin story
Portnoy, the founder of Barstool Sports, bought approximately $2 million worth of Bitcoin in 2020 but then sold it in August, right about the time when MicroStrategy bought its first BTC batch.
He confessed to Saylor today that he got triggered by the news that the Winklevoss twins stated back in 2020 that Elon Musk was going to space to find limitless amounts of gold. That made the Barstool Sports owner panic and he sold his BTC. This year, in the summer, he said he would be back in the game and would buy BTC if it dipped to $40,000 per coin.
Saylor explains Bitcoin and Satoshi to Portnoy
Answering Portnoy’s questions, Michael Saylor explained to him Bitcoin using sports metaphors and compared BTC to a team of champion players like Michael Jordan, etc, who are digitized and can play forever. You can watch or you can play with them, he said, and if they score more than you do, you still win together, Saylor explained. No matter, where you go, Saylor said, there are hundreds of millions of people on the team Bitcoin. “You should join team Bitcoin,” he told Portnoy. “And you do not just win the game, you get wealthy while you win the game,” Saylor added.
As for Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious individual or a group of them, who founded Bitcoin, Saylor told Portnoy that Satoshi was a real person but it does not matter who he is or was. “We are all Satoshi now,” he used that popular cliché when answering. Saylor likened Satoshi to Prometheus who stole fire from ancient Greek gods and brought it to people, therefore, likening Bitcoin to fire – the thing that had a fundamental impact on human life in the centuries to come.
Saylor also reminded Portnoy that “Bitcoin gives you control of your money.” That’s “egalitarian, humanitarian, and economically smart,” Saylor believes.

news/analytics/30201329/,Is Chainlink (LINK) Ready for a 40% Surge Toward Its $52 All-Time High?,"Despite a slight pullback, Chainlink technical indicators such as “golden cross” suggest continued upward momentum for the token.
Chainlink’s collaborations with major organizations like SWIFT and Euroclear are helping drive its adoption in blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi).
Chainlink (LINK), the decentralized oracle network token, seems to show signs of moving towards reaching its all-time high record at $52. Recently, LINK price has gained over 26% in a week and nearly 85% in a month. Hence, analysts are now expecting the LINK token to attain a fresh all-time high in 2025, per the CNF report.
Chainlink Price Technicals Indicate Bullish Momentum
Powered by technical indicators and an increase in institutional interest, LINK’s price stands at $24.93 and appears to be nearly 50% below its peak, an opportunity for a big push. Currently, despite the slight pullback today, the Chainlink price chart is showing increasing bullish momentum.
The token’s 20-day moving average (MA) is at $19.32, which may serve as a support level for lower price levels. Market observers are watching for the “golden cross,” a technical pattern in which the 100-day MA is about to cross over the 200-day MA, typically considered a strong bullish sign.
Meanwhile, LINK’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 74.24. This metric shows that the token is almost at the overbought level but has scope to move higher. Moreover, the  Average Directional Index, at 52.83, depicts a strong trend in the price movement.
Furthermore, the Moving Average Convergence (MACD) Divergence histogram depicts a strengthening of positive momentum. It signifies sustained buying for Chainlink’s native token as investors look forward to an upward momentum, guaranteeing significant profits.
Market Trends Show Mixed Picture
This weekend, the LINK price managed to see a 9% price pump while the trading volume dipped by around 11%. The trend of high prices against low volume and decreased activity is often bullish and reflects steady accumulation with little speculative trading. More often than not, a pattern like this is believed to be a bullish phenomenon, highlighting the growing level of interest in LINK.
However, owing to today’s downturn, the derivatives market looks unstable. According to Coinglass, the LINK open interest dropped 2.02% to $709.82 million. Whilst, the long liquidations hit $3.42 million, suggesting a significant sell pressure in the market. This could potentially negatively impact LINK price action in the short term.
A Look At Chainlink’s Major Collaborations
Chainlink’s strategic partnerships with major organizations, including SWIFT, Euroclear, and prominent financial institutions, are playing a key role in its broader adoption. These collaborations enable the development of blockchain-based solutions and tokenized assets, highlighting the network’s utility within decentralized finance (DeFi) and other blockchain ecosystems, reported CNF.
On December 3, Chainlink’s official Twitter account (X) showcased its work with prominent companies and financial institutions. This public acknowledgment increases confidence that Chainlink plays a significant role in the blockchain industry’s critical infrastructure.
With more adoption in blockchain, the demand for reliable and secure oracle services such as Chainlink’s is growing. This enhances the position of the network as a key player in the rapidly evolving decentralized finance space. It could eventually benefit the LINK price in the long term as the token adoption grows alongside the ecosystem growth.",https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/is-chainlink-link-ready-for-a-40-surge-toward-its-52-all-time-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-09 17:10:33.428895,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/545/545262d7d739d35195521c2b0a6678dd44863610.webp,Successfully Scraped

Earlier this month, BIT Mining announced that it would continue to merge mine Litecoin (LTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE). The company attributed this to the huge profits that the firm netted from self-mining both LTC and DOGE in the past year.
As of November 27, 2024, BIT had mined a total of 84,485.42 LTC and 227,908,250.38 DOGE.
“The recent rally in Litecoin and Dogecoin, fueled in part by Elon Musk’s influence and the changing regulatory landscape in the US after the Trump win, has had a major impact on mining profitability,” Dr. Youwei Yang, BIT Mining’s chief economist and vice president of mining, said in a statement.
LTC and DOGE prices have surged 73% and 117%, respectively, in the past 30 days. Bitcoin, which recently surpassed $100,000, gained 31% during the same period and has risen 126% over the past year. Meanwhile, BTCM stock climbed 29% in the past week.

Ripple (XRP) dropped to a low of $2.40, down by 16.2% from its highest level this year, bringing its market cap to $138 billion.
Its retreat followed Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple Labs’ CEO, appearing on 60 Minutes, the popular program on CBS. In an X post after the interview, he noted that it was edited to exclude some of the details.
Specifically, Garlinghouse highlighted that 60 Minutes did not mention XRP’s status as not being a security, a position confirmed by a federal judge in 2023.

In its most recent results, Ripple said that the network handled over 172 million transactions in the third quarter, a 99% annualized increase. The network burned 598,477 XRP tokens generated from transaction fees, a 21% increase from the same period last year.
XRP price has performed strongly over the past few months, becoming one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies. It surged 382% from its lowest level in November, positioning it as the third-biggest cryptocurrency in the market.
This rally was fueled by optimism that Donald Trump’s Securities and Exchange Commission would adopt a more crypto-friendly stance compared to Gary Gensler’s tenure.
In line with this, investors anticipate that Paul Atkins may decide to do away with the pending appealby the agency. Also, the agency may approve a spot XRP ETF as soon as in 2025.

The most likely scenario suggests XRP could drop to retest support at $1.9700 before resuming its uptrend. This break-and-retest pattern is a common continuation indicator.
Further XRP price gains are expected if the coin surpasses the year-to-date high of $2.90.",https://crypto.news/why-did-xrp-price-drop-after-garlinghouses-60-minutes-interview/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-09 17:10:34.196029,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/d7b/d7b7b36645207f363652ff73def46449e877aabd.webp,Successfully Scraped
news/analytics/30201922/,Shiba Inu price and burn rate are falling: time to sell?,"Shiba Inu price suffered a harsh reversal on Monday, Dec. 9, as Bitcoin and other altcoins retreated.
Shiba Inu (SHIB) dropped by about 7% to a low of $0.000030, much lower than this month’s high of $0.000033. Other popular meme coins also experienced declines, with Popcat (POPCAT), Peanut the Squirrel, and Dogwifhat (WIF) leading the way.
Shiba Inu’s retreat coincided with a significant drop in its burn rate. Data from ShibBurn showed the burn rate decreased by about 90% to 413,412 SHIB coins. This marked a sharp decline after a wallet burned 250 million SHIB coins in a single transaction on Friday.
Shiba Inu has burned over 410 trillion SHIB coins since its inception, leaving 589 trillion coins in circulation. This burning process is expected to continue over the long term, which could make the remaining coins more valuable.
Meanwhile, data from Shiba Inu’s ecosystem indicates positive growth. Shibarium, a layer-2 network, has processed over 623 million transactions since its inception. It recently surpassed 2 million total addresses, while total BONE transfers have risen to nearly 2 million.
ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange within the ecosystem, has achieved over $28 million in total value locked. The number of transactions in the network has increased, and annualized fees have risen to over $3.2 million.

The daily chart shows that SHIB’s price reversed after rising to the significant resistance level of $0.00003280, its highest level since March 28.
Shiba Inu price formed a golden cross pattern as the 200-day and 50-day Weighted Moving Averages crossed. The coin appears to be forming a cup and handle pattern, with a depth of approximately 67%.
By measuring 67% from $0.00003280, the target is set at $0.00005478. The coin will need to surpass its year-to-date high of $0.000045 to confirm movement toward this target.
The bullish outlook will be invalidated if SHIB’s price drops below the 50-week moving average at $0.000026.

news/analytics/30201785/,Hyperliquid (HYPE) Price Drops After Billion-Dollar Airdrop Momentum Fades,"Hyperliquid (HYPE) price surged by 60% after its billion-dollar airdrop, which distributed 310 million HYPE tokens to users. This surge was followed by a brief period of overbought conditions, as indicated by its RSI rising above 70.
However, the momentum quickly waned, and the RSI has since declined to 44.8, signaling a neutral or slightly bearish sentiment. Despite fluctuating net flows, which reached an all-time high of $181 million on November 29, HYPE’s price remains under pressure, with recent drops in both net flows and price levels.
HYPE RSI Is Currently Neutral
After its airdrop, HYPE RSI briefly surged above 70, indicating that the asset was overbought.
However, this momentum didn’t last, and the RSI started to decline. It is currently sitting at 44.8, suggesting a neutral or slightly bearish sentiment.

RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It ranges from 0 to 100.
An RSI above 70 is considered overbought, while an RSI below 30 indicates oversold conditions. An RSI of 44.8 suggests that HYPE is neither overbought nor oversold. In the short term, this could imply that HYPE’s price may remain stable or see slight downward pressure if momentum continues to weaken.
Hyperliquid Flows Reached An All-Time High On November 29
Hyperliquid net flows chart shows a significant increase, reaching an all-time high of over $181 million on November 29. Afterward, it dropped to $66 million on December 5, then rose slightly to $69 million on December 7.
However, on December 8, the net flows dropped dramatically to $9 million, and currently, it stands at approximately -7 million dollars.

Net flows refer to the difference between the total inflows and outflows of an asset or investment within a given period. Positive net flows indicate more funds are entering than leaving, while negative net flows show the opposite.
Despite still having more inflows than outflows overall, the sharp decline in net flows to negative levels could signal a loss of investor confidence or a shift in market sentiment. This drop could indicate potential price instability or downward pressure in the short term, as outflows surpass inflows, signaling a potential reversal in market sentiment.
HYPE Price Prediction: Can HYPE Go Below $10 In December?
After its airdrop, HYPE price experienced a significant surge, reaching a high of $14.99 on December 7. This increase was followed by a period of consolidation, where the price stabilized, before it began to decline gradually.
The market seems to be in a state of uncertainty, with a slight downward momentum taking hold.

If HYPE manages to recover its earlier bullish momentum, it could potentially rise again and challenge resistance levels near $15. This could set the stage for a further upward move, with the next target being $16, as perpetual DEX platforms continue to attract attention.
On the other hand, if the current downtrend continues to gain strength, HYPE price could test its first major support level at $11.29. If this support proves weak, the price may continue to drop, potentially reaching $10.44, signaling a deeper bearish trend.",https://beincrypto.com/hyperliquid-hype-price-drops-after-billion-dollar-airdrop/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,2024-12-09 17:10:34.974860,https://cnews24.ru/uploads/766/7661d72142a30e8368fb8e9493e2afe5a5f3160c.jpg,Successfully Scraped
